<p>Four gargantuan steam frigates armed with Paixhans guns, belching darkened smoke, emerged from across Edo Bay into Uraga Harbour as Manifest Destiny bestrode leading the civilizational force westward barging over the Pacific unto the Sakoku. It was neither the first nor last time that the Japanese imagination was to be captured by that which emerges from the Pacific. Though its population was to be awoken from their halcyon slumber, elites in Sakoku Japan and the Tokugawa Shogunate were well-aware of the expanding powers of Western nations that had already tamed the Chinese through the Opium and Arrow Wars and the resulting unequal treaties. The dissonance nestled within the body politic, domestic and that which is foreign and alien would result in deep uncertainty and precipitous internal change in search of a new harmony that would come to define the restless Japanese spirit of the time. It was July 14, 1853, Emperor Meiji was 6 months old.</p>

<p>To discern the impetus behind the fateful steps the Japanese took upon the Pacific, one has to be conscious of the historical spirit that compelled the institutions and  structured the faith and experience of the men who embarked upon such a flight. As such, we shall return to where the steel of the Imperial Army, that was forged under of Yamagata Aritomo as a vanguard for the accelerated modernisation regime of Japanese society under the Meiji Restoration, entered a new phase of life after the natural death of the watchful eyes of the genro class. One that engendered renewed factional strife within the armed forces and across the Kokutai at the tail end of the Great War into a world of turbulent change. The words penned by Yamagata will yet remain haunting the nation in search of yet another new harmony, “should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth”. The foreign that is ever-present in the Japanese mind would re-emerge in the Far East Russian frontier, one emblematic of the many to follow.</p>

<p>Across the floes of ice the glistening Golden Horn Bay of Vladivostok receded behind the horizon as General William S. Graves and the last echelon of the American Expeditionary Force returned back across the Pacific, back home. <label for="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">America’s Siberia Adventure 1918-1920 is a first-hand account by William S. Graves himself about the US Siberian Expedition to
</span> In the nineteen weary long months that passed, the American force had in their view served as a stabilizing force in the Siberian situation, one that illustrated “the eccentricities of a remote and irrational emanation from the central madness of a warring world.” as Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, put it. Baker was the one who had charged  General Graves with command under direct orders of President Woodrow Wilson as to render together with the Allies such “aid as shall be acceptable, to the Russian people in their endeavour to regain control of their own affairs, their own territory, and their own destiny.” consonant with the Wilsonian ideals of self-determination and collective security . Successive revolutions in Russia has seen its central sphere of influence diminished leaving the resource-laden Siberean fringes and the accompanying strategic backbone of the Trans-Siberian Railway unguarded. While the British and French were desperately attempting to resurrect the Eastern Front with a White Russian government beyond the Urals, the Japanese channeled their efforts into  establishing an independent buffer state in Siberian Russia east of Lake Baikal between the ascendent Bolsheviks and Japan’s northern territories. General Graves and the American forces had the thankless task of implementing these principles to their best of their abilities executed as to act as a counterbalance the Japanese and the belligerent Cossack Atamans, the Japanese had armed and enabled. The muddled mess of irreconcilable ambitions and vacillating priorities created in Baker’s own words “a situation which made necessary the withdrawal of all Allied forces from Siberian soil when it was withdrawn, thus making impossible territorial conquests and acquisitions on Russian soil by other nations whose interests in the Far East might easily have induced them to take over for pacification, and ultimately for permanent colonial administration, vast areas of Russia’s Far East”. By 1919 the Red Army was rapidly streaming eastwards unimpeded towards the Whites sheltered in Omsk and on December 29, 1919, Graves received orders to prepare his troops for withdrawal. Within 20 years, Vladivostok will re-emerge as a critical nexus in the Pacific Route of the Soviet-American Lend and Lease program that would sustain the Soviet War Machine.</p>

<p>The very same year of 1919, the whirlwind of Chinese anti-imperialism and nationalism was ignited in reaction to their government’s capitulation to the unreasonable demands of the Treaty of Versailles, “from the Russo-Mongolian Treaty and the twenty-one demands down to the latest Sino-Japanese compact by which a corrupt administration had bartered away the heritage of the whole country over the heads of the people”, that culminated in the epochal May 4th Movement. Once again the ideals and the letter of the Fourteen Points articulated by the American delegation and President Woodrow Wilson at the helm failed to live up to its promise and clout. In fact, Paul S. Reinsch envoy to the Republic of China would proclaim between 1913-1919 highlights that  “probably nowhere else in the world had  expectations of America’s leadership at [the] Paris [Peace Conference] been raised so high as in China. The Chinese trusted America, they trusted the frequent declarations of principle uttered by President Wilson, whose words had reached China in its remotest parts.”(Xu, G.,et al, 2005, 269)  Wilson caving on the demands and willingness to compromise his principle of self-determination conceding the Shandong Peninsula to the Japanese in the pursuit of the supra-national goal of creating a League of Nations left the Chinese disillusioned that swelled into deep popular outrage. Bestirred was a national consciousness, especially amongst the youth from a long slumber, an assertion that self-determination of the peoples was not an illusory commitment to be discarded from their collective vision, but one that can be realised independently of the Great Powers foreshadowing the ideological splintering of the nation to come.  What the movement lacked in systematic organisation and mobilisation it would soon find “if properly organized, considering its strong points, grit, doggedness and determination, it could be the greatest force in China for the exposition of Japanese camouflage.” (Baronti,1920)</p>

<p>Japan that had dreamt of a permanent solution for their northern problems in the fragmented husk of Tsarist Russia was to be stuck in a quagmire for another two years till 1922 in the Far East and China that was weakened and divided was biting back and in both theatres the Americans and their failed machinations were in interplay. When the foreign players were weakest the Japanese internal national compass that was reactionary by design splintered as a divide between the once aligned army and civilian population grew exacerbated by the rural rice riots of 1918 (amplified by Japanese government redirecting rice stocks to the Siberian frontier where Japan already had deployed 10 times the troop numbers required by the Americans stationed). The early 1920s marked the nadir for the Imperial Army as harnessing this wave of popular energy civilian political parties were able to forge paths into initiating democratic reign upon the Imperial forces. Civilians favored a conciliatory approach toward China embodied in the Shidehara diplomacy approach respecting the rational position and non-interference in China’s internal politics. Both the Siberian and Chinese problems found resolution in the Washington Naval Conference where Kijūrō Shidehara acted as lead negotiator reverting Shandong to Chinese control and leave Siberia. It was seen as a victory for peace and disarmament, especially amongst the antimilitarist in the Diet reducing naval expenditure and stabilizing fleet size. The year that marked Yamagata’s death revealed the internal rifts that will define the coming decade are cracking just under the surface. In his diaries, Army Minister Kazushige Ugaki writes “The removal of troops from Shandong, the evacuation of Hankou, and now the withdrawal from Siberia have become realities. Those independent actions of the empire have all come to nothing. Nay, as in the case of our stationing troops in Shandong, which was our right by treaty, there is the tendency to relinquish the great proportion of our special rights and withdraw. Thus we further contract our noticeably diminished national prestige and national rights.” The aura of pride that was associated with the Imperial Army in the staff colleges was in dissonance with the tailspinning of the Imperial Forces in recent years amplified by their increasing technological and organisational backwardness with regards to the Great Powers. These factors would reinvigorate a new core of young officers that wished to rearticulate the historical raison d’etre. The need of deep-seated reforms and the radical paths taken to pursue them led to the recurrent phenomenon  Gekokujo, where lower-ranked officers often with the sympathies of higher ranked ones carry out highly disruptive events. This was already a phenomenon recognised during the Siberian Intervention in the incident of covert war material aid was shipped to Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin as the matter of “how to dispose of the vast stores of war materials lying around Vladivostok became acute.” (Dunscomb, 2006). Such actions served to intensify uncertainty and control of on-the-ground operations, especially in remote territories further hamstringing civilian control of military actions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Soviets were consolidating control. Stalin would proclaim looking back in January 1925 that had “capitalist countries not been engaged in mortal combat during the imperialist war in 1917, had they not been clutching at each other’s throat had they not been busy with their own affairs and unable to spare time to wage a struggle against the Soviet power,  it is doubtful whether the Soviet power would have survived. The struggle, conflicts and wars between our enemies, I repeat, constitute an extremely important ally for us.”(Stalin, 1925) This is a lesson that the Party will not forget. The “future Japanese-American war” for capitalist “supremacy” in the Pacific, for the “right to loot” was one Lenin looked forward to.  “They want to fight, they will fight.”, he said.  “As soon as we are strong enough to defeat capitalism as a whole we shall immediately take it by the scruff of the neck.”(McMeekin , 2021) he proclaimed in a speech delivered at a meeting of nuclei secretaries of the Moscow Organisation. The machinations of the Third International (Comintern) were initiated explicitly devoted to world revolution and the overthrow of existing capitalist governments. In this way, Communist subversion was aligned with the Soviets instead of their own governments, by fueling political extremism on both left and right, that drove the Marxist-Leninist dialectical process of radicalisation. This movement erupted in the consciousness of the Japanese in the Toranomon incident where a son of a member of the Imperial Diet, Daisuke Namba, was radicalised and attempted an assassination of Emperor Hirohito. “To the very end of the trial, Namba maintained his faith in communism. As he heard the sentence of death, he cried out: “Japanese Proletarians and Japanesec Communist Party, Banzai!” and “Russian Socialist Soviet Republic, Banzai!””. The danger of anti-monarchist foreign ideologies that Japan had attempted to buffer itself from earlier came to haunt the political and intellectual spaces. As a reaction, the Public Security Preservation Law was passed under which, “Anyone who has formed an association with the aim of altering the kokutai or the system of private property, and anyone who has joined such an association with full knowledge of its object, shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding ten years.”(Mitchell,1973, p.19) The word Kokutai served to communicate the law’s intention to assert and preserve the essential character of the Japanese way of life to a people and an internally polarising elite class in the face of volatility and change. However well meaning it was, introduced into a still nascent parliamentary system it proved to be a death knell at containing the nation’s worst impulses during the events of 1930s that would follow. Radical actors often practicing Gekokujo appealed to the sympathies of a public that was caught up in a nationalistic fervour claiming “to have acted with the kokutai in mind. They attacked those misadvising the emperor or violating some other rightist commandment in order to strengthen the kokutai and to reroute the nation’s course. Thus, judges found themselves on trial in their own courtrooms, along with the body of law, by the very suspects and lawyers who lined up below them.” (Mitchell, 1973, p.29). Assassination and attempted coup events sidelined or eliminated potential restraining voices near the Emperor while any potential for civilian leadership would end up being untenable due to an environment of fear and groupthink tragically when political discernment and balance was needed the most in the lead up to the Pacific.</p>

<p>China’s reassertion of authority under the flag of the Republic of China was underway with the Northern Expeditions and increased Soviet presence particularly in the Soviet-Sino conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway in Norhtern Manchuria and subversive activities within China increased the necessity of the Japanese to assert a foothold in the continent due to their already significant investment in Southern Manchuria. The Showa financial crisis and passivity in the face of aggression upon Japanese assets by the National Revolutionary Army had already booted the Minseito  government and its Shidehara’s diplomacy patterns out. “Through the South Manchuria Railway Co., it already operated the principal rail line and ports and controlled the principal industrial and mining developments.” (Stewart, 1935). The Mukden Incident occurred at the heights of the Great Depression in Japan, “for the Depression had greatly stimulated the sense that Japan was in the midst of an all-encompassing crisis, or had reached a ‘stalemate’ (yukizumari), of which the ‘population problem’ was an important part. Calls from agrarian moralists, rural groups, and politicians with rural connections for increased emigration and state-supported emigration schemes became loud” (Wilson, 1995)” Coupled with a fiscal expansion and monetary expansion policies of finance minister Korekiyo Takahashi  Japan’s economy was able to recover by 1932. This substantial capital and goods were invested into Manchoukuo, “Of all the phases of development work, the extension of railways and other communications has proceeded most actively. A new and imposing capital has also been constructed at Hsinking. At the same time, industrial development has been pushed. A number of new industries have been established ; the iron and steel, coal and oil shale industries have been expanded; and the output of industrial salt has been increased. Efforts to stimulate cotton and wool production have also been made. Moreover, imports have risen rapidly, so that Manchoukuo now occupies first place in Japan’s export trade.” (Stewart,1935) Cartelization and rationalization were promoted under government guidance, one that was simple to transition into the total war economy envisioned by the Toseiha Faction of the Imperial Army preferred by the zaibatsu as free market economics floundered at solving the crisis.</p>

<p>The Xi’an incident in December 1936 was a pivotal crisis during the Chinese civil war sparked by the mutiny of Chang Hsüeh-liang  and Yang Hucheng against Chiang Kai Shek to shift his stratagem away from communist suppression and internal pacification to find a political solution with the communist on a United Front against the Japanese. Initially the, Chinese Communist Party that had been cornered in an ongoing civil war was exultant and wanted Chiang fired and handed over to a peoples’ tribunal, however soon after “Zhou  Enlai  and  Mao  Zedong called for a peaceful settlement and the protection of the safety of Chiang Kaishek. On 18 December, they sent a telegram stating that their call for Chiang’s dismissal and trial had been ‘inappropriate’, and that he should be released if a United Front against Japan would be formed.  This u-turn was the result of a telegram on 16 December from the Comintern, which stated that ‘regardless of Zhang Xueliang’s intentions, objectively seen, his actions can only harm a united front to resist Japan and benefit Japanese aggression in China’ and called on the CCP to ‘firmly advocate a peaceful settlement’”(Van de Ven, 2003, p.187). Soviets had feared an alliance between the Kuomintang Nationalist and the Japanese either through Chiang Kai Shek or Wang Jingwei that would have had the Soviets facing a potential two-front war spanning two continents during the war that was about to break. Mao Zedong himself asserts such a condition being hostile to the survival of the Reds, “Splits and wars among the warlords weaken the power of the White regime. Thus opportunities are provided for the rise of Red political power in small areas. But fighting among the warlords does not go on every day. Whenever the White regime in one or more provinces enjoys temporary stability, the ruling classes there inevitably combine and do their utmost to destroy Red political power. In areas where all the necessary conditions for its establishment and persistence are not fulfilled, Red political power is in danger of being overthrown by the enemy.” (Tse-tung,1928) Koki Hirota as Foreign Minister in late 1935 had in his 3 principle approach to diplomacy as the third principles called for Sino-Japanese co-operation against Communism in China highlighting the possibility of such an approach for the Nationalists. Mao’s principle of revolutionary war thus rested on the possibility enjoining of the civil war in China with national war and as such a prolonged engagement between Japanese imperialist against the Kuomintang during which it can expand its own strength. As such the active phase of preparing for the impending war with Japan began in China.</p>

<p>On July the 7th of 1937 a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops near Peiping in North China, along the rail line connecting Beijing with the port of Tianjin. Chiang Kaishek penned the following in his diary, “The  Japanese  bandits  have  made  provocative  actions  at  the  Marco  Polo  Bridge. Are they trying to subdue us before we can complete our preparations; or are they making trouble for Song Zheyuan. … Is this the time to accept the challenge?”(Van de Ven, 2003, p.188). Earlier that morning, central military headquarters in Tokyo received a situation report and the army chief of staff decided to downplay events and cabled instructions to the local Japanese commander to work out a settlement with his Chinese counterpart, a common approach in the resolution of minor incidents in northern China. Kanji lshiwara, Chief of Operations in the Army General Staff, who was one of the architects of Mukden Incident agreed with his colleagues who saw the Soviet Union as Japan’s most immediate strategic problem in northern Asia and wished not to invite “the same sort of disaster which overtook Napoleon in Spain a slow sinking into the deepest sort of bog.”(McClain, 443), Also on the very same morning “the Communists issued an appeal for all Chinese to resist “the new Japanese invasion,” and within days Chiang demonstrated his commitment to the “spirit of Xi’an” by directing the military commander in Beijing to reject the terms offered by the Japanese.”  Concurrently, the generalissimo began to move four of his best divisions north into Hebei Province, an open violation of the He-Umezu Agreement and Tanggu Truce” (McCain, 445), a ceasefire that was signed between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan in 1933 ending the Manchurian invasion  by establishing a demilitarized zone extending south of the Great Wall. Consequently though, “by July 11 the Chinese and Japanese commanders on the scene had appeared to work out a modus vivendi” (McCain, 445), in alignment with the Konoe’s Cabinet support to reach a resolution locally amongst the commanders on the field , the Marco Polo incident  instead would flare up into a bitter war of attrition lasting 8 years, a war that would not end.</p>

<p>Soviets would intensify its border in the Far East against the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War as skirmishes and crossings at the border increased while Japan dragged weary men into the immensity of the heartlands of China into the 3rd year: a war machine sustained by oil and resources from the foreign powers. The attacks  of the Operation 100 on May 3 and 4, 1939 were the first systematic carpet bombings of Chongqing , after the establishment of front-line operations for air support and logistics  that can stage such joint-strike attacks, in an attempt to force a surrender. “Over the two days, the campaign comprised seventy-two bombers, 504 pilots and a total payload of 600 tons of fragmentation and incendiary bombs. Not one Japanese Imperial Army soldier had set foot on the soil; the attackers had released their bombs from an attitude of 3,000 meters, introducing people to the bitter taste of terror from the sky. The campaign left 4,400 dead and thousands more wounded. The death toll surpassed that of Guernica to establish a macabre new record for aerial bombing.” (Tanaka)  These attacks fortified the spirits of the people attacked while vilifying the Japanese forces further in the eyes of the Great Powers. Just 8 days later, on “May 12 Kwantung Army frontier guards observed about 700 Outer Mongolian cavalry crossing the Khalkha River. The Japanese immediately decided that this was a frontier violation. ”(Young, 89).  The Kwantung Army would act independently without referring the matter to Tokyo and against the wishes of the General Staff,  a repeating motif as we have previously seen, that would come to shape the future of its role in the coming war.</p>

<p>Thus, sparked the beginning of “the Battle of Nomonhan at the Manchurian—Mongolian—Chinese border. The Japanese attacked first with an infantry division, but encountering stiff resistance, in July the Japanese assembled 475 aircraft, including Mitsubishi A5Ms and Nakajima Ki-27s. The Soviets’s 1st Army Group commanded by General Georgii Zhukov had poured troops into the area and had 580 aircraft available, including 125 SB-2s, 25 TB-3s, and 150 I-16s. In August, the Japanese and Soviets were engaged in the biggest air confrontation since the First World War. When the Japanese brought in tanks and infantry forces, on 23 August, General Zhukov struck back and crushed the Japanese 23rd Division in one week.” (Hans Ven, 236) 23 August will also be when the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed an event that shocked the Japanese while it was in an undeclared battle with the Soviets. A deeply consequential pivot in Japanese-Soviet relationship was to occur as the General Staff and War Ministry  aware of the strength of 30 divisions stationed by the Red Army in the Far East and overextension of the Imperial Forces in China would sign a truce by ways of their Soviet ambassador Shigenori Tōgō before reinforcements even arrive for the Kwantung army. Increasingly after the Nomonhan incident the defend the south advance the north form of expansion doctrine, espoused by like figures such as Kanji Ishiwara in the Imperial Army, was sidelined. Though Kwantung Army Special Maneuvers a preemptive attack strategy on the Far East or Siberia were planned  it would never materialise. Two years later, Togo himself would sign the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact that enabled the Soviets to focus upon the European theater of war while Japan advanced with their Strike South doctrine favoured by the Imperial Navy headed to challenge the pre-existing Pacific spheres of influence.</p>

<p>The views of Nelson T. Johnson, US Ambassador to the Republic of China were affirmed, observing in the February of 1938 that “Communist Russia expects to profit by the chaos that Japan is creating, and sees safety for itself in a Japan that is exhausting itself in China.” Soviets were already through the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact sending aircraft and raw materials to help hold off the Japanese Invasion. Washington was well aware in their gauging of the strength of their Soviet ally, the fact “that Japan was not going to be able to consume China; that the Soviet Union was pleased with the weakening of Japan due to its operations in China; that, even though the purges had led to some doubts as to the effectiveness of the Soviet forces, Soviet Russia was still Japan’s biggest fear and its most formidable military foe: and that the danger of a possible conflict between them was still high, if not higher than before. Clearly, the idea that American interests could be protected by continued Soviet-Japanese tensions was now commonplace in the Roosevelt administration.”( Kennedy, 108) America would overlook the all-invasive threat the Soviets and their ideology would engender while the Comintern and Soviet threat that plagued Japan in the 1930s had already been festering in essential centres of its own body politic within the classes of the New Deal Administration under Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

<p>By 1941, the fragility of the peace upon the Pacific was palpable, as for Japan as it treaded a narrow path to what appears to be an inevitable destination. The Hull-Nomura Talks of 1941 were thus the last resort to diplomacy between the two countries. A Sword of Damocles lay over Prime Minister Konoe’s head domestically as he attempted to navigate this narrow path. The Americans, “President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull well realized the probability that Japan had already gone so far in a policy of conquest that it would be impossible to persuade her to stop. Nevertheless, entertainment of even a faint hope that there might be worked out a fair and peaceful settlement in the Far Eastern area impelled this Government to agree to participate in exploratory conversations in order to ascertain whether there was sufficient agreement on basic issues to warrant entry upon more formal negotiations.” (United States, p.120)  Though exploratory for the Americans it was a matter of greatest urgency for the moderates in the Cabinet to reach an amicable resolution with haste. “great attention must be paid to the fact that the United States is pursuing its established policy without alleviating the economic pressure on Japan in the least.”(Department of Army, 1945 , p. 56) as fuel and other vital supplies drained as each day passed.  The Japanese negotiators would fail at discerning and accepting the vision the American elites were envisioning of the framework for a world economic order that didn’t neccesitate aggressive militaristic expansion to sustain. The Americans were ambivalent and slipped into generalisations and backsliding on many of what Japanese viewed as major issues in American eyes such as American economic freedom in China and Manchukuo, a shared front against communism in the North and the case of its neutrality if America entered the war. The two plans confirmed during the Imperial Conference on 5 November, Plan A and B serve illustrate the point. “The secretary of State then told” Ambassador Nomura upon receiving and asking few questions about a Plan A that “he would give an answer to each problem after further study”. However, the President “was noncommittal and it was felt that virtually Japan’s proposal was shelved.” (Department of Army, 1945 , p. 71)</p>

<p>On November 26th Hull would hand a plan of a broadly defined settlement for the Pacific Area “as one practical exemplification of a program which this Government envisaged as something to be worked out during future conversations” (United States, 142) where demands that had no precedent in previous series  of long running discussions such as that “not to support any government in China other than the National Government of the Republic of China with its capital temporarily at Chungking; to relinquish extraterritorial and related rights in China and to obtain the agreement of other governments now enjoying such rights to give up those rights” (United States,1943, p.143)  appeared. The political and social infeasibility of these additional commitments only served to belie the indifference of the Americans to  the domestic stakes involved for Japanese elite and their people.  President Roosevelt on December 6th a day before the Pearl Harbour Attacks would “telegraph to Tokyo, a personal message to the Emperor of Japan in which he stated that developments were occurring in the Pacific area which threatened to deprive the United States and Japan and all humanity of the beneficial influence of the long peace between the two countries, and that these developments contained “tragic possibilities”.” (United States, 1943, p.147)</p>

<p>Here is a land and a people defined by their lofty ideals, led towards expansion into foreign lands that it had once isolated itself away from others across vast oceans having to find itself isolated again amongst others. Such a statement could define both nations across the Pacific. However, it wasn’t the spirit of Japan that led it blind into its ill-fated adventure but the rigidity of its institutions whose evolution aborted fell into self-involving . The Shōwa Restoration embodied an ahistoric revanchism attempting to reinvoke a lost time disembodied from the historical realities of the time: a microcosm of the Japanese Society as a whole as it was at war with itself before it was against all. The shadow of the Black Ship had once cast upon Edo Bay bound a tale of two nations. The rising sun had come chasing in its shadow’s footsteps across the Pacific only to realise it had been one cast by its own light.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="sapiens" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time; And power, unto itself most commendable, Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair To extol what it hath done.

<p>In a subcontinent mired in contradictions: a colorful cacophony of splendor and squalor resounding a mere paper’s thickness away and more often than not appear as one and the same. A mere snapshot would do no justice to the unabated circus of life and death that simply overwhelms an unready spectator. Where the profane struggles to assemble anything that resembles order. However here purposeful rectilinear urban blocks emerge against the encircling chaos of wayward dirt paths and mismanaged infrastructure that had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man’s purpose. Euclidean geometry willed against the organic dynamics of non- linearity. Perhaps this could be explained away as the conjurings of the bureaucratic nucleus cloistered at the heart of the borough. Yet a distant pulse drowns this intuition. Averting one’s gaze few miles south uncovers the underlying, both in the literal and figurative sense, beat of the heart that this urban edifice drums along to. A topography of open wounds unfurls. Towering terraced bowls stagger into a downward descent pursuing veins of lignite. Relics of a lost geography; what were once contours of the land displaced by retaining walls and stabilized slopes. The superconstruct of detritus stands silent, witness to 2600 ton of German engineering ingurgitating through its underbelly as the various industrial mechanizations reshape this landscape not unlike how an artisanal potter molds malleable clay into the form he sees fit at the nearby Night Bazaar. Paired with a thermal power station built under the Indo-Soviet assistance programme it was the realization of the Nehruvian vision of an energy bridge for the Indian economy into the future. Nonetheless, the barren blanched lunarlike canvas serves only to betray the scope of mankind’s uneasy and disquieting relationship with nature. It’s a revelation of the unrestrained violence required to assemble our supply chains and markets: a form of decentralised planetary disassembly, mortal structure derived from perpetual discord. A reflection of the wider metabolism of our contemporary society that has been hijacked by the inarticulable forces that lay beneath. Thus, we encounter the grand dissonance that lies within the heart of modernity that transcends far beyond the mere spatiality of subterranean shafts and bureaucratic warrens of a small township, where I was born into this implicit modern covenant: one forged through the channelling of Nature’s very own laws upon Nature through the hands of Man.</p>

<p>Man’s recasting of the natural world cannot be merely understood with regards to the implements of technology at his disposal, but instead through the framework that enables such manipulation, for the former would be confusing the armaments of war with the essence of war in itself. Observe in the final chapter of “Discourse on Method”, as René Descartes pronounces the technological aspect of the Cartesian project that through ”knowing the force and action of fire, water, air, the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies that surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our artizans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to which they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and possessors of nature.”  Natural philosophy was no longer a matter of mere contemplation no longer satisfied with merely  embracing and unveiling the secrets of the world, but at making them serviceable to definite ends, set to reconfigure the human condition. A rupture with pre-existing relations with Nature awaiting to be staged. An interrogation of nature under the torture of instruments of science for subsequent reconfiguring of these very forces as inputs into human civilization. Seminal thinker Martin Heidegger in “The Question Concerning Technology”, referred to the tendency such a mode of inquiry has wrought within the hallways of modernity as Gestell translated frequently as enframing. Referring to interrogation of nature in modern physics, Heidegger apprises that “Because physics, already as pure theory, requests nature to manifest itself in terms of predictable forces, it sets up the experiments precisely for the sole purpose of asking whether and how nature follows the scheme preconceived by science.” Thus, such a process “drives out every other possibility of revealing” or looking at things, imposing, upon the multiplicity of natural phenomenon from that of a flowing river to the icy tundras, an ordering he called “standing reserve”. The richness of the natural world reduced as resources to be put to man’s service, a river to be dammed, a tundra to be drilled, potentialities to be captured. <label for="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Heidegger’s thought deepens with the conception of the Fourfold.  [H]uman being consists in dwelling and, indeed, dwelling in the sense of the stay of mortals on the earth. But ‘on the earth’ already means ‘under the sky.’ Both of these also mean ‘remaining before the divinities’ and include a ‘belonging to men’s being with one another.’ By a primal oneness the four—earth and sky, divinities and mortals—belong together in one. Earth is the serving bearer, blossoming and fruiting, spreading out in rock and water, rising up into plant and animal… The sky is the vaulting path of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter of the stars, the year’s seasons and their changes, the light and dusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency of the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether
</span> However, what is to occur when these apparatuses of capture are directed at forces closer to home upon man himself.</p>

<p>Just as Prometheus thrust his hands into the Empyrean to recast divine fire for the utility of man, humanity brought about tidings of his own subsequent downfall in his attempts at individuating himself from nature through the application of its very own laws. Pascal would succinctly express the sense of alienation such an enterprise invokes in his “Pensée” for “All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms, are not worth the smallest mind, for a mind knows them, and itself, and bodies know nothing.” Such a conception of a vacuous desacralized world only serves to reimagine man, as a stranger to the world, who fulfils his station as sovereign in his search for knowledge; a prime mover subject to nothing more eminent, bestriding upon the natural world as Colossus. Man’s own nature was thus to experience an axial shift as the essence of the tools he built to control Nature’s forces seeks to subsume human agency itself. “The Lord of the World is becoming the Slave of the Machine, which is forcing him — forcing us all, whether we are aware of it or not — to follow its course. The victor, fallen, is dragged to death by the raging team.”, Oswald Spengler proclaims in Man and Technics. Just as the tools of Homo Faber takes its form from the shape of the hand, the tools in turn informs and shapes us. We might have domesticated wheat through the birth of agriculture but that in turn domesticated us. The imperial gaze of technology redirected upon himself. In Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “Ode, Inscribed to William H.Channing” man is atomised into the alpha versions of what these days economic systems term human capital.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The horseman serves the horse,<br />The neat-herd serves the neat,<br /> The merchant serves the purse,<br />The eater serves his meat;<br />‘T is the day of the chattel<br />Web to weave, and corn to grind;<br />Things are in the saddle,<br />And ride mankind.”<br />
––– Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ode: Inscribed to William H. Channing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here tragically it is mankind that is to be ridden, Homo Faber reduced to the “standing reserve” servicing the role of reproductive organs of our tools and propagating the assemblages with the shadow world of tools. These tools however merely express the social forms capable of using and creating them as such mankind’s attempts at transcending nature through this mode of creation are but Pyrrhic victories. Man becomes subject to his own modes of capture: a stranger to himself. Entrapped within a disenchanted illusory mirrorhouse of his making in his retreat from Nature, one wonders the chances the Nature that he has forsaken augurs for escape.</p>

<p>Nature offers the possibility of reintroducing the sacred within our midst integrating the sensual realities of older traditions of consciousness to pierce through the illusions of modernity. Native Americans named the cannibalistic spirit that deludes us into sapping and enframing the life-force of all beings and systems of Gaia: Wetiko. Such a spirit they claim blinds an individual through illusion from recognising the interdependent and enmeshed nature he finds himself in beyond the poles of such dichotomies such as Man &amp; Nature, subject and object. Henry David Thoreau in Walden prominently declared, “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind.” (Thoreau) Henry David Thoreau in Walden speaks to men haunted by just such a spirit of Wetiko masked and a cause of disillusionment and ennui. In what is ostensibly a travelogue, Henry Thoreau takes a boat trip north along the Concord River in “A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers” running off on the most erudite digressions regarding the fecund tapestry that is sensual experience “ We need pray for no higher heaven than the pure senses can furnish, a purely sensuous life.”, he proclaims , ”Our present senses are but the rudiments of what they are destined to become. We are comparatively deaf and dumb and blind, and without smell or taste or feeling. Every generation makes the discovery, that its divine vigour has been dissipated, and each sense and faculty misapplied and debauched. The ears were made, not for such trivial uses as men are wont to suppose, but to hear celestial sounds”. For Thoreau, the depths of conscious sensory experience assist in the distillation of sacred truths from the “slumbering subterranean fire” that is the natural world. Unlike his close friend Ralph Waldo Emerson and fellow Transcendentalist, Thoreau erected no transcendental barriers or higher reality to mediate this process of clear wide-eyed contemplation.</p>

<p>Necessary, however, was the active cultivation of one’s receptivity to the beauty of Nature for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" data-wiki-lang="en" data-wiki-title="Henry_David_Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> was akin to the act of “nature looking into nature with such easy sympathy as the blue-eyed grass in the meadow looks in the face of the sky”. Thoreau aspired to scale Olympian heights by grasping the theological character of the interface between our senses and nature for he believed man need not only to be spiritualized but “naturalised on the soils of the earth”. Thus one would be able to “see, smell, taste, hear, feel, that everlasting Something to which we are allied, at once our maker, our abode, our destiny, our very Selves; the one historic truth, the most remarkable fact which can become the distinct and uninvited subject of our thought, the actual glory of the universe; the only fact which a human being cannot avoid recognizing, or in some way forget or dispense with.” The senses we utilize to engage and navigate the across the vacuous meaningless husk of materiality – exemplified in “the mass of men”, trapped within the spider webs of their conscious experience. Widen ajar one’s aperture of awareness and the very same apparatus of sensory perception unleashes a combinatorial implosion into Oneness as our sensory faculties parse the encodings of divinity layered within the hidden seams of natural phenomena.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Go round, come round, come round, O distant time<br />Come round, call back my heart<br />Come round, call back my heart<br />Birds, bugs, beasts, grass, trees, flowers<br />Teach me how to feel<br />If I hear that you pine for me, I will return to you.”<br />
— The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, A Celestial Maiden’s Song //「天女の歌」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a philosophical thought experiment supposedly posed by George Berkeley that goes along the lines of “if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”
Often consensus coalesces around the conclusion that though such a tree falling may cause tremendous vibrations of air but would not make sound for there are no ears to hear.<label for="marginnote-2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Berkeley’s own answer to this riddle however rests upon the perception of the infinite spirit itself one that perceives in the absence of anyone else. “All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth - in a word, all those bodies which compose the frame of the world - have not any subsistence without a mind.”. Here once again man grasps the divine purpose through the sensory world resting upon the Mind as the pre-configuring node upon which the phenomenon of the  world rests.
</span> Such is also I would attest the nature of the descent of consciousness within society - it happens unperceived to some but resoundingly loud to those attuned to such change. However just as imperceptible is the silent germination and gestation of consciousness that follows within the collective tributaries of our mind.  As a species the foundry for the artefacts of escape exists within us. In the clearing between our neural synapses where the stuff of dreams are forged. That twist in our collective neural pathways that plays make believe. The foundation of the human psyche. In our amphibious traversals in the twilight zone between these coexisting planes of the Mind and the Terrestrial. The unfolding of conscious experience, the Phoenix as the re-expression of its ashes. “What is needed is care; a great deal of patience; and the laying aside of many preconceived opinions, wishful dreams, and the blind sway of demand” as Jean Gebser puts it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="nature" /><category term="techne" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the mountain they felled my trunk All my schemes come to ‘naught Without shame a troubador am I I know trouble, my brothers!

<p>Before the Age of Enlightenment could shroud the body of society in it’s shadow it had to first
decenter man from pre-existing traditional structures of control and understanding of knowledge.
Enter René Descartes who augured in across multiple domains of human thought, a vision of the
natural world that continues to exude a gravitational pull upon modern discourse. This
reconfigured the mystical character of neo-scholastic natural philosophy into one built upon a
budding mechanistic paradigm of his era.</p>

<p>For Descartes his radical notion of doubt was only a detour to a more secure edifice of knowledge
one that Descartes believed resided in the power of the mind to capture and represent reality in a
box. Ironically, or perhaps unironically, reframing the question of what is true to be what one can
be certain of, was a Trojan Horse of a particularly corrosive strain when the object of
interrogation is of the theological character. Considering the political climate Descartes found
himself in it isn’t surprising that it maintains the dogmatic attributes of Christian faith while
simultaneously attempting to render it epistemological.</p>

<p>The cartesian self is built as a function that serves to reason insulated against the swamp waters of
alterity stripped of the relations other than those mediated by divinity. As Oswald Spengler put it, “The symbol of the West is an idea of which no other Culture gives even a hint, the idea of Function” - plotted here in Cartesian coordinates. Reason is an assiduously crafted function that acts as a fort against this ocean It is a fortified boundary, sealing out everything uncertain, irresoluble, a sea-wall much like those built by the Dutch during the 1500s against the unknown. Cloistered within the bounds of such a sea-wall, one is well protected from the existential oceanic despair that exists beyond, a Faustian memorandum of understanding deal with the evil demon that resides beyond these walls. An amphibian stuck on dry land.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="humanity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now I a fourfold vision see And a fourfold vision is given to me:Tis fourfold in my supreme delight,And threefold in soft Beulah’s night,And twofold Always.

  <p>Let A Hundred Flowers Bloom; Let A Hundred Schools Of Thought Contend <br /> 
— Mao Zedong, Hundred Flowers Movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the later years of Confucius’ life, one of his earliest disciple Zhong You wished to pray for an ailing Confucius. To which he earnestly responded that - “My life has been my prayer”. Confucius was born to an era of decline and turmoil within Chinese history as the instruments of legitimacy that grounded the Zhou Dynasty floundered, The Warring States Period. As the “metaphysical” breakdown deepened, violence was articulated across all dimensions of societal structure as political power was accrued and accreted and dissipated. However, the virulent political transition nourished the soils of creative destruction as a hundred schools of thought blossomed through the clearing of space.</p>

<p>Confucius attempted to locate human society within a larger cosmology present in the cultural consciousness pulling various strands of ideas from the past. Confucius proclaims, “To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.” Governance depends ultimately on the education and cultivation of elements of community a process of becoming chun-tzu etymologically shifting a noble birth into a more meritocratic concept. These individuals in turn spontaneously emerged into a larger weaving of social structures through the lines of articulation known as rites.</p>

<p>Social and cosmic order was rendered in a rich interweaving of internalized codes of civility that played out as rituals (li 禮 ) encompassing the entire spectra of terrestrial interactions. It was as such that Confucius confronted the increasing degeneracy of his times by asserting the rich tapestry of human agency enacted sacred in the primal ecology of a self generating harmonious cosmic order. This infusion of the secular with sacred dimensions is remarkably apposite in an age where the profane has devoured and totalizes upon the edifice of most human interactions. The profane space has no axis mundi upon which to pivot, no center to rest leaving the human spirit restless and wandering without orientation. Perhaps in the fragmented amorphous spaces of modernity one needs just such a map that unravels the tears in our perceived reality that unveil the sacred.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="sapiens" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let A Hundred Flowers Bloom; Let A Hundred Schools Of Thought Contend — Mao Zedong, Hundred Flowers Movement]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Hacker Known as 4chan</title><link href="https://kosmonautx.github.io/sapiens/the-hacker-known-as-4chan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Hacker Known as 4chan" /><published>2019-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kosmonautx.github.io/sapiens/the-hacker-known-as-4chan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kosmonautx.github.io/sapiens/the-hacker-known-as-4chan/"><![CDATA[<blockquote>

<p>Experiencing the rush of entering the amorphous highways at the nexus of the Western Hemisphere’s meme economy would overwhelm the uninitiated. Behind this unassuming GeoCity-era interface, lies the mimetic potency for a thought to christen itself superfluid, overflowing into the semiotic circuitry of the rhizomatic rivers into deltas of the internet. As one and many, the network that is 4chan weaves semiotic chains cognitive and mimetic in nature that often is looked upon as straight up weird or repulsive.</p>

<p>The topology of the cognitive resonance exhibited by 4chan has erupted from a lack of primarily two structural impediments, one the lack of the need for even pseudonymization, most of the network goes by “anon” short for Anonymous, and the other is the lack of data retention. Notably antithetical to current identity orientated and data fetishized paradigms of Big Tech, the lack of a persistent state and permanence of actors in the networks has led to distinctive flavor of virtual social dynamics and semiotic terrain for incentivizing certain mutating tendencies of the lines of discourse. Due to a distinct lack of a Skinner Box-like reward system, the only corrective incentivization barometer in 4chan is pegged against one’s fluency and hyperliteracy in the discourse, which favors individual’s adept at handling mimetic lightning through the subvertion of the internal patois and manipulation of in-group markers of signification. The production of memetic rituals just like that of great books as Proust would say, “are written in a kind of foreign language.” Continuous variation and iterations result in semiotic concoctions that ephemerally radiates across the byways of the digital libidinal economy often with collapsing logic, semantics and pragmatics.</p>

<p>Jonah Peretti laid the <a href="https://www.datawranglers.com/negations/issues/96w/96w_peretti.html">theoretical foundation</a> for his media empire - Buzzfeed in a piece where he posits that “A successful contemporary politics has stakes in defining the rhythmic flow between schizophrenic and identificatory impulses.”  4chan in this sense synthesizes a form of meta-stable unity of transient individual identities. In the flatlands of pure image and representationalism to those that are entangled within the webs of epidemic communication the words of Bane would resonate “No one cared who I was ‘til I put on the mask.” Namelessness makes failure costless (through the absence of identity and thus cultural capital) and re-enforces the distributed topologic dynamic through the curbing of centralisation and hierarchies of status. Though one can claim a stable identity through the process of trip coding, those who do are often met with hostility for being attention-starved and branded as “tripfags” for their sense of self-importance thus suppressing what the system views as taboo or radical behavior. This starkly juxtaposes against systems and services built upon the paradigms of radical transparency that rely on the coupling between the lived and virtual self.</p>

<p>This anonymity while fostering experimentation and recursion however doesn’t compromise on decision-making due to the previously noted lack of persistence of state where threads are dropped chronologically, stabilization through reboot of threads or the system of bumping is viewed as accretion of the cultural and social capital for larger scale mobilization of the tribe. This phenomenon has been a critical topic of interest for information operations and the Fifth Estate for its proven capacity to reshape the Digital Maginot Lines and the fluid battleground of the theatres of war on the web.</p>

<p>The prolific Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges builds a world Tlön where its inhabitants speak a language that lacks any nouns. The narrator speaks of a thinker who “advanced a most daring hypothesis. This felicitous supposition declared that there is only one Individual, and that this indivisible Individual is every one of the separate beings in the universe, and that those beings are the instruments and masks of divinity itself.”  Similarly, the sublimation of the virtual space that 4chan holds has enabled a dance of just such masks that resonates as an unitary artefact propagating virulence and modulating the zeitgeist. However, behind these very  masks are the eyes wide shut?</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="techne" /><category term="ethnography" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased.

<p>Hari Seldon in the Foundation Universe would attempt to formalize and project human behavioral systems – just as Maxwell &amp; Boltzmann had for the behavior of large-scale action of gas molecules – through the formulation of a stochastic fictional science called psychohistory. Dr Seldon when questioned about the strength of the Romanesque Galactic Empire answers, “However, Mr Advocate, the rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might that it ever had.

</div>

<p>Alphabet’s X moonshot factory internally circulated memo demarcates the contours of the deliberations that whistle  through  within the conglomerate. Though such creaking can be interpreted as an attempt by Google to recast their dominant attention and data capture dragnets as tools for social good, an intriguing endeavor would be to probe the implicit ideological framings at work further through an <a href="#" data-wiki-lang="en" data-wiki-title="Verstehen">interpretive process</a>. Rationalisation and specifically “Zweckrationality” – one “ determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as “conditions” or “means” for the attainment of the actor’s own rationally pursued and calculated ends” – in aggregate such behavior manifests itself in the macrocosm of the firm that acts as a centralized conduit for the distribution and processing of information. The expressed collective cognition of the human capital circuitry within such institutions align organizational and energetic capacities and potentialities towards a lodestar of the “greater good”. Such visions are articulated in mission statements such as “Don’t be evil” or “Think Different”. As such wills to power unfold over time such institutions inevitably cross the Rubicon into the inhuman. Such sentiments are echo’d in Weber’s concluding lamentation in the Protestant Work Ethic within the expansionary “tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt.”.</p>

<p>One could recognize the apocalyptic nature of the statement in the Ancient Greek sense of the word as in to unveil - a glimpse into the primordial alterity of the world. The selfish ledger appears to an apotheosis of a line of thought through the exhaustion and subsequent extrapolation of the human condition. A culmination of the Weltanschauung of Ratio one concerned primarily with abstraction. The billiard ball of causality hits the corner pocket as the predicate and the subject are interwoven into an assemblage of enunciation. In the process the Weberian ideal bureaucrat is summoned with an ideal amorphous face. The gears of controls have shifted. Lines between agency, attention and perception itself have blurred. Kafkaesque visions of the bureaucratic labyrinth have transmogrified into a rolling open world of machinic time. A cybernetic ecology where one can’t disambiguate between freedom and control, where one is merely an aggregate. The antagonisms that have fractured the Enlightenment underbelly momentarily reveal as the sea recedes before the great storm to come. Yet there is time to stay cocooned in the procrustean exfoliations of our minds all watched over by machines of loving grace.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vivekbala</name><email>avivekbala@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Sapiens" /><category term="techne" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

The Pravda christened it as an ‘artificial moon’ one that had scaled up the terrestrial gravity well, which had bound humanity to this Pale Blue Dot. Alan Shepard had just graduated from the Naval War College. John F. Kennedy was still a junior senator from Massachusetts. Yuri A. Gagarin was an unremarkable Russian military pilot. While the ‘father of rocket technology’: Wernher von Braun was working on the Jupiter ballistic missiles. Little did these men know this unpretentious small sphere would manage to capture human imagination and paranoia: metastasizing in the global consciousness and cast a very large shadow indeed. A new era of exploration was about to dawn. It was the 4th of October 1957 and the Soviets had just launched the Sputnik.</p>

<h3 id="humanity-got-odyssey-inside-my-dna">humanity, got odyssey inside my DNA</h3>

<p>The history of humanity has always hung onto a timeline of exploration. For millennia, since modern humans emerged in the horn of Africa we were wanderers. We meandered past vast landmasses, across forbidden seas and narrow straits, down rolling valleys in search of plentiful game and congenial climates. The impetus to explore has had unmistakable survival value. As the last ice age ended and the ice thawed, we settled down marking the beginnings of the Neolithic Age. We domesticated plants animals, and in turn they domesticated us.</p>

<p>Thenceforth empires have risen, developed, devolved and fallen, blood has been spilt in the name of gods, pharaoh and queen. As change came to define human history, the itch for exploration was one that was sempiternal regardless of ones ethnicity, ideology or geography. Phoenicians surveyed the Mediterranean Sea pushing through the Pillars of Hercules (Strait of Gibraltar) into the Atlantic. Polynesians settled on every habitable island in the Pacific till Hawaii traversing 16 million square miles of treacherous ocean guided by just the stars and the currents whilst Vikings touched the coast of modern day Canada half a millennium before Columbus. On the behest of Admiral Zheng He, Ming Era ocean going junks crisscrossed the Indian Ocean sailing as far away as Hormuz on the Persian Gulf and Aden on the Red Sea. The Age of Discovery saw Europeans (re)discover the New World subsequently circumnavigating the globe. In recent times, few of us have claimed the adobe of the gods of old soaring 400km up. We owe these feats to a restless few: irrepressible renegades drawn by a yearning that they could barely understand nor articulate themselves.</p>

<h3 id="jfk-and-his-technocrats">JFK and his Technocrats</h3>

<p>It is a humbling irony that spaceflight—conceived in the tile cauldron of nationalistic rivalries and vitriol—was the harbinger of a shared human vision. Tremendous acceleration of the space programme in the 1960s, got humans to the moon before the end of that decade. John F. Kennedy as a president was lukewarm on committing to an aggressive space program before pivotal events in 1961. He was not a starry-eyed idealist enraptured with the romantic image of the final frontier in space nor consumed by dreams of a spacefaring civilization. On the other hand, he was a maestro of cold war rhetoric with a keen sense of Realpolitik in foreign affairs. Yuri Gagarin’s orbital mission aboard Vostok 1 coupled with the failed Bay of Pigs debacle, displayed the Kennedy administration’s technical and strategic incompetence as the power struggle over the ‘fluid battleground’ of the Third World tipped in the Soviet’s favour. United States’ security hinges as much on winning hearts and minds as it does on military might. Thus Kennedy in a bid to recapture leadership in space so as to project America’s soft power believed <a href="https://youtu.be/WZyRbnpGyzQ?t=14">“that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth”</a>. The challenge required the mobilization of resources on a national scale to develop and apply the pioneering technologies of their times. This in turn called for skilful management of administrative capacity, a responsibility that fell upon NASA and the Federal Government. A frontier narrative was sold to the media and the public by the administration subsuming arguments about the technology and economics of the program, and established a presumption in favour of massive commitments of the nation’s resources to manned space flight. The Cold War realities of the time, therefore, served as the primary vessel for an expansion of NASA’s activities launching the premier civil space effort to a broad consensus of support. ‘We came in peace for all mankind’ the lunar plaque placed by Apollo 11 crewmembers read while megatons of explosives were being dropped in Vietnam.</p>

<h3 id="children-of-apollo">Children of Apollo</h3>

<p>The Apollo space program, however mired it was in Cold War jingoism, accentuated the undeniable recognition of the interdependence and frailty of the Earth. The first-hand transcendental experience of viewing the blue ball of life floating in the great enveloping darkness, shielded by a paper-thin atmosphere has been proven to stem a cognitive shift in thinking, time and time again by astronauts and cosmonauts alike. National boundaries vanish. The conflicts that divide us become trifling and the full folly of human conceits come to bare. Just as humanity conceived instruments of death capable of exceptional self-harm, this revelation underscored our responsibility to protect this fragile biosphere and all its members emboldening the environmental and humanitarian movements of recent decades.</p>

<p>In the realm of science and technology, rock and soil samples brought back are still vital to lunar and planetary science investigations. Lunar surface layers serve as archives frozen in time storing records in the form of solar wind particles, the cosmogenic products of cosmic ray impacts, and meteoritic debris. The wealth of information derived from the chemical and mineralogical nature of the lunar surface has reshaped and enriched our knowledge of lunar origins, geological evolution and thus informing us of the more general processes of planetary formation. These soil layers have been studied extensively elucidating the processes critical to understanding the development of our early inner Solar System ranging from core formation to magmatic activity to solar evolution.</p>

<p>Spillover technological developments, the result of huge government autonomous investments pushed the boundaries of civil, electrical, aeronautical engineering and the sciences. This financial kickstart for fledgling technologies resulted in a technological trickledown which has rippled down the decades that followed. Precision matching, robotic welding and assembly, photovoltaic cells and the list goes on. For instance, Apollo Guidance Computer designed by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory was central to the evolution of the integrated circuit, forerunner to the microchip, and is regarded as the first embedded system. The guaranteed market and premium prices paid by the NASA and military in the early days of the Integrated Circuits were decisive factors in determining the success of the industry, and led toward mass-produced, low-cost chips for the subsequent personal computing and the unprecedented digital revolution.</p>

<p>Under the aegis of the Apollo program, we augured in the golden era of space exploration stretching till the 1980s before the traumatic Challenger incident. We dispatched engineered robotic spacecraft to the far recesses of the Solar System, conducting reconnaissance of dozens of alien worlds. From the flybys of the Mariners and Pioneers to the soft landing of the Soviet Venera 8 these probes functioned as windows into these distant worlds illuminating our understanding of our Solar System. Utilizing the gravity assist manoeuvre, the Voyager Probes took advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that occurs once every 175 years to send probes on a “Grand Tour”. These probes reshaped our view of the gas giants and have just crossed the heliopause, destined perhaps eternally to be runaways in the stellar void of the Milky Way.  While manned spaceflight stalled, planetary science thrived. We currently have dozens of these robotic emissaries sending us back wondrous data daily.</p>

<h3 id="withdrawal-syndrome">Withdrawal Syndrome</h3>

<p>Since the heydays of space exploration being buffeted by the winds of political change has become standard operating procedure for NASA. The Apollo Program inspired the generations that followed, a story of ordinary people realising extraordinary dreams. Nonetheless the  widespread consensus which spawned it would prove to be an anomaly: the result of an elusive alignment of national decision-making process with the aspiration of space exploration. Amusingly for a program designed to demonstrate the superiority of the free-market system, it succeeded by mobilising vast public resources within the mechanizations of a centralised bureaucracy under government directive. Proposals had been drawn up for a more resilient human presence in cislunar space, involving more substantial infrastructure such as reusable shuttles, orbital transfer vehicles, propellant depots and permanent space stations orbiting both Earth and Moon. However, these were discarded except for a scaled back Space Shuttle program under the Nixon Doctrine. Public-Private partnership for commercial activity in space, which could have served as a bypass to the government centric control and execution of the national space program, didn’t arise either. Thus, the very bureaucracy that landed man on the moon in less than a decade, would end up stifling further manned spaceflight as the political rationale that once fuelled it evaporated.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="merchants-betwixt-worlds">Merchants betwixt Worlds</h2>

<p>Enterprise has always thrived more strongly in the presence of strong private and social incentives to reward risk-taking. Ming Dynasty China was a centralised bureaucratic monolith. There was little marketplace for ideas beyond those the state approved and promising ventures – such as Zheng He’s naval expeditions in the early 15th century to promote trade links across East Africa and the Indian Ocean – could be and was scuppered by imperial decree. Conservative risk averse factions in court viewed these extravagant tours as unwise wasteful expenditure expressing widespread disapproval. The succeeding Emperor Hongxi adopted a more sustainable inward-looking policy and eventually in 1525 the government ordered the destruction of all oceangoing ships. Thus, the potential of the Treasure Fleet and Ming Dynasty’s maritime pre-eminence was never fully realized.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast, Europe, flanked by and shoved out by the dominant Ottoman Empire to the East, comprised of many small, fragmented, weak and increasingly warring states. Thus, political geography served as an impetus to rulers who were desperate for sources of revenue especially through lucrative trade routes to feed burgeoning mercantilism at home and their ratcheting military appetite. Headstrong or obstinate (depending on how you see it) men, sponsored by the ruling class, compelled by faith, greed and grandeur would attempt to navigate the seas for alternate routes to the Indies. The greatest blundering genius of them would probably be Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus who rarely knew where he was, let alone where he was going but open the gates to the riches of the New World (or as Columbus would have you believe even on his deathbed the Orient) he did. The magic of it all is if Queen Isabella had rejected Columbus’s proposition or if Columbus himself crashed into some boulder, the ports of Europe had lionhearted men and the wealthy aristocrats required to bankroll them aplenty. Consequently, the voyage to the New World would have occurred regardless.</p>

<p>In the dizzying years that followed, almost anything and everything seemed possible to the conquistadors and adventurers who crossed the Atlantic and rounded Africa sustained by innovations in financial instrumentation and continent-wide market activity. The rest as they say is history, Europe plundered and got a whole new continent while Native Americans subjugated, got smallpox. These events transpired due to compelling incentives, however unscrupulous or delusional, for individuals who would end up tilting the axis of the planet in the West’s favour. About four centuries later, the Spirit of St. Louis, in lieu of Santa Maria, full flying speed – controls taut, alive and straining – would attempt to conquer the Atlantic, this time however heading back to the Old World in search of the City of Love.</p>

<h3 id="the-lindbergh-boom">The Lindbergh Boom</h3>

<p>It was the May of 1927, a lone monoplane emerged from across the Parisian horizon. In the spartan cockpit was an obscure air-mail pilot from over 3000 miles away. As Charles Lindberg descended on the Le Bourget Field to the adulation of crowds numbering in the 100,000s, the aviation industry took flight. The historic non-stop flight across the Atlantic displayed the potential of long distance flight. In no time, Wall Streeters were banging on doors, policy makers churning out civil air safety guidelines and capital flew in as interest in commercial aviation skyrocketed. Within less than a century, a world without aviation is unimaginable.</p>

<p>The dreams of flight and that of private space flight are twins, conceived by similar visionaries and evolving with many parallels. Just as the Orteig Prize of $25000 motivated Charles and his backers to attempt to cross the Atlantic, the 10 million-dollar Ansari X Prize incentivised Burt Rutan’s (legendary aerospace engineer who also designed the first plane to fly around the world without stopping or refuelling) Scaled Composite backed by, co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen. They launched the rocket-powered SpaceShipOne from a mothership 14km up. It arced through space and crossed the Karman Line, an arbitrary line which lies at an altitude of 100km, and repeated the feat within a week kickstarting the dreams of the commercial spaceflight industry. This time it was deep pocketed billionaires spawned in the nucleus of the 21st century start-up culture who went knocking on doors as they set their gaze up to the stars seduced by the commercial potential of human access to space.</p>

<p>Private spaceflight reawakened the promise of manned spaceflight. Rockets require vast time, resources and expertise to be assembled, launched into space, and in the end either unceremoniously burnt up in the atmosphere or crash into the ocean as scrap metal. Imagine an aviation industry as inefficient, the only aircraft flying around would be Air Force One. The need for an inexpensive reusable vehicle has been the obvious step for the 40 years since the Apollo Era. The Space Shuttle program was conceived on that very premise, aiming to launch payloads for under $100 a pound with one launch per week on average. However, NASA never delivered and instead trapped man within Low Earth Orbit for 30 years. After each mission, the orbiter and the solid rocket boosters required extensive inspection and repairs, consequently getting to orbit remained a risky and expensive proposition as NASA struggled to translate the reusable orbiter and solid rocket boosters to tangible capex savings. The program reached an anticlimactic halt in 2011 after 133 successful flights with a payload cost of an exorbitant $10,000 per pound. Compared to the $81 million per astronaut NASA pays the Russians to send them to Low Earth Orbit on the Soyuz, the entire SpaceShipOne endeavour only cost $27 million. After selling the technology to Virgin Galactic founded by Richard Branson, Paul Allen turned a net profit and suddenly the free market economics of spaceflight appeared workable resulting in a dynamic explosion in spaceflight that government alone can never hope to mimic.</p>

<p>By then, real-life Tony Stark, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, had already established under the radar aerospace companies, Space Exploration Technologies Corp and Blue Origin respectively. Both were enamoured by chimerical dreams, one of multi-planetary expansion and the other of lifting heavy industry into outer space with millions living and working off-world.  From having vodka shots with Russians for the purchase of ICBMs on the open market to recovering Apollo F-1 engines three miles beneath the Atlantic, these visionaries seem to have gotten immunization shots for risk that the rest of us forgot to get when we were born. Irrespective of their differences over means of fulfilling their ambitions, they agree that the final frontier proffers the solution to the quagmire we are tangled in on Earth.</p>

<h3 id="vectors-of-infection">Vectors of Infection</h3>

<p>Planet-bound civilizations not only impose limitations on the material enlargement of civilization, it also places us as a species in a precarious spot. We reside in an inter-galactic neighbourhood that is dynamic armed with a couple of definite ways to sterilize the thin film of life inhabiting the surface and countless more theoretical ones. When it comes to destruction of worlds we also happen to be our worst enemy. Nations possess thousands of nuclear warheads capable of occasioning an existential catastrophe, and we are at the liberty of a fairly fragile global ecosystem as we belch greenhouse gases to fuel our ever-increasing needs and wants.</p>

<p>It could be argued there is a moral imperative to act on behalf of life itself of which we are at least the bearers, if not the sole possessors, to act as its dispersal vector. Life since it’s inception has reached out to cover every niche it can. Neil Armstrong’s first words on the Moon were a massive understatement, that step was as significant as the one our amphibian cousins took 400 million years ago onto land. Being a spacefaring civilization is the first step toward assuring the durability of civilization and ensuring our visibility to natural selection on a cosmological scale. This vision of making life multi-planetary was one that would transmogrify a spreadsheet into SpaceX that would in the coming years re-enact a sophisticated parody of David and the Goliath.</p>

<h2 id="draining-the-swamp">Draining the Swamp</h2>

<p>In an industry brimming with middleman price hikes and literally decades-old legacy technology, SpaceX’s firmly controlled in-house supply chain and trailblazing technology has it competing as the world’s cheapest option for space delivery even besting China’s Long March’s price point. Whereas established commercial launch consortiums like International Launch Services and Europe’s Arianespace once scoffed at the California upstart, the success of SpaceX has them rapidly scrambling to cut their own launch costs and pursue reusable rockets of their own as their decade long military-industrial complex business model heads for the dust heap of history. For years, the US government had relied on two major aerospace companies—Boeing and Lockheed Martin, along with their joint venture, United Launch Alliance (ULA)—for domestic launches. They made their money through pulling strings at Capitol Hill and cozy military and government relationships for vastly inflated sole-source contracts ( SpaceX will sue the Airforce over this to be certified for military and intelligence payloads) costing an average of $380 million per launch. Traditional aerospace companies tend to outsource their production to sub-contractors and these contractors in turn sub-contract to layers further down the supply chain, resulting in massive overheads. Their operations were bloated and technology were stale hardly distinguishable from their Soviet and now Russian counterparts. In fact, ULA’s Atlas III and later the Atlas V, were powered by Russian RD-180 first-stage rocket engines. That’s right US defence satellites, which probably snoop and spy on Russia, can’t be launched without the Russians themselves. SpaceX brought the tsunami - organizational ethos of Silicon Valley: lean manufacturing, vertical integration, flat management to this stagnant swamp of an aerospace industry. Engendering the tectonic shifts in propulsion technology, spacecraft design and reusability requisite for this tsunami to take form, however, has been anything but easy.</p>

<h3 id="its-tough">It’s tough</h3>

<p>For 6 long years, a good 4.5 years more than expected, SpaceX wrestled with the chains of gravity. Three times, from the spring of 2006 to the summer of 2008, it had seen the lean, single-engine Falcon 1 rocket lift off from an atoll in South Pacific only to fail to reach orbit. By then Elon Musk had sunk hundreds of millions of dollars in developmental cost, racking up personal debt and both his companies Tesla and SpaceX had little revenue to show for it. On September 28, 2008, a cash-strapped SpaceX executed its first successful launch becoming the world’s first privately built rocket to achieve Low Earth Orbit. In SpaceX’s darkest hour as it struggled to meet payrolls, NASA ushered in the dawn offering SpaceX a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract to make 12 deliveries for them to the International Space Station. This infusion of cash reinforced the capital-intensive transition from a single Merlin-engined Falcon 1 rocket to the much more exigent <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9">Falcon 9 rocket</a> and the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/dragon">Dragon Space Capsule</a>. What followed were rapid succession tests and iterations to achieve cadence with the Falcon 9. Milestones were cleared one after another. First privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft. Check. First to dock and berth a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Check.</p>

<h3 id="elons-reusable-ark">Elon’s Reusable Ark</h3>

<p>Concurrently the reusable launch system technology development program would evolve to become the focal point of SpaceX’s energy and resources. The low-altitude, low-velocity hover/landing test vehicle, Grasshopper and the subsequent vertical-launch &amp; vertical-landing Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicles served as a development testbed for SpaceX’s first propulsive landing of an orbital rocket’s first stage on land in December of 2015. The audacity of the concept and breakneck pace of development has been breath-taking to witness. On April 8, 2016, Falcon 9 Flight 23, delivered the <a href="https://youtu.be/O5bTbVbe4e4?t=1371">SpaceX CRS-8</a> cargo on its way to the International Space Station while the first stage conducted a boostback and re-entry manoeuvre over the Atlantic Ocean. Nine minutes after lift-off, the booster landed vertically on an autonomous drone ship aptly named ‘Of Course I Still Love You’, 300 km from the Florida coastline, achieving another long-sought-after milestone for the SpaceX reusability development program. SpaceX has indicated that they are now able to consistently “reenter from space at hypersonic velocity, restart main engines twice, deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity”. To date, SpaceX has successfully brought Falcon 9 first stages back to Earth 21 times during orbital missions, and four of those landed boosters have flown again. Though engineers initially shelved the idea, they now intend to develop the technology for a scorching re-entry to extend reusable flight hardware to second stage. This is a more daunting technical challenge considering the vehicle is travelling at high delta velocity usually so that the payload can reach geostationary orbit.</p>

<h3 id="invisible-pressurised-glove">Invisible Pressurised Glove</h3>

<p>2018 is starting out with a bang (not a literal one I hope) as the current phase in SpaceX’s journey culminates with the maiden launch of <a href="https://youtu.be/sNgByUWwFKU">Falcon Heavy</a> happening this week. Between the mission in the Dragon 2 to the ISS flown under NASA’s Commercial Crew Development Program marking the first manned launch from US soil since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 (it’s competing against old guard, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner) and the slated plans of sending two space tourists on a free return trajectory around the Moon, this year is shaping up to be hopefully the most riveting year in the SpaceX saga. To realise his visions of a sustainable human civilization on Mars, Musk is now diverting resources into a next generation rapidly reusable spacecraft named as ‘BFR’ ,which is capable of producing an astounding 52 meganewtons worth of thrust at sea level (That’s right enough to lift off with an adult blue whale as payload and land back with it). But it gets better, this colossus of a rocket will have the lowest marginal cost per launch accounting for reusability of any spacecraft ever. This could in theory lower the cost of lifting material into orbit by an entire magnitude. The cost of the propellant (fuel/oxidizer combo) on the BFR is absurdly low as the Raptor engines, currently under development, only rely on liquid oxygen and densified liquid methane. As the cost of placing and maintaining capability in space falls dramatically, it transforms sense of possibility providing a platform to leapfrog the feasibility of every endeavour in space. The presence of this robust commercial market, in turn, through economies of scale, would result in a further fall in the cost of access to space. Suddenly the heavens themselves, appear pedestrian.</p>

<p>Here is the wonderful part. Just as in the ports of Europe 500 years ago, where private and social incentives galvanized men with heartwood of oak to sail the Atlantic, so too it inspires the innovators of today to spearhead through the atmosphere into orbit. SpaceX is not alone. Blue Origin has successfully completed the fifth launch and landing of the very same suborbital New Shepard rocket and crew capsule. Bigelow Aerospace has already launched inflatable space station modules into Low Earth Orbit. Orbital ATK has made deep investments in developing its on-orbit robotic satellite servicing capabilities to tackle space logistics challenges. NASA in partnership with the private firm Made in Space has installed a 3D printer customised to operate in microgravity in the ISS, this opens the door to on-orbit manufacturing using the very materials that in the future might be sourced in space. Companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries are beginning work on asteroid mining capabilities to prospect and extract materials, minerals and even synthesise propellant through processes such as electrolysis in space. These headways if proven sustainable would eventually mature to fully fledged industries. These are few of the multitude of pathfinders in the bottom-up emergent order which is redefining the space industry (if I talk about all these endeavours with more depth, I would be suffering from Alzheimer’s by the time I would be done but thankfully the cure for it would have been discovered as well). It is no wonder why analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect the private space industry, which is valued at $350 billion right now, to octuple to nearly a $2.7 trillion valuation in the next 30 years as one realises we are sitting on the precipice of an entrepreneurial metamorphosis.</p>

<h3 id="the-scarred-knight">The Scarred Knight</h3>

<p>To a generation that felt the risk-averse sclerotic government tethered space program had failed them, their dreams of spaceflight might be actualised. You need look no farther than compare the development of the Falcon series of vehicles with the NASA Ares 1, Ares 5, and now the Space Launch System. NASA is currently betting on large appropriations in the coming years that will enable it to undertake a massive, Apollo-like undertaking to set sail for Mars. However, it has not been able to command that kind of budget since the 1960s.</p>

<p>The fundamental barrier is institutional. The space agency has been squeezed and suffocated by parochial Congressional meddling for years. The political establishment of today neither has the will nor the resolve to pursue a concerted long-range initiative towards manned spaceflight beyond the Low Earth Orbit. From the days of the Raegan Administration Star Wars program, where space architects dreamt of kinetic and particle beam weapons and all kinds of bedlam, flip-flop has been the name of the game for the mercurial American Space Policy. Take this century as an exemplification, first there was the George Bush era Constellation program that was supposed to develop a sustained human presence on the Moon but instead America categorically decided it’s better to have a sustained human presence in Iraq. Upon taking office, President Obama declared the program to be “over budget, behind schedule, and lacking in innovation” cancelling it and redirecting NASA’s focus to sending people to an asteroid, and then once again set its sights on a human Journey to Mars. Then Trump’s Space Directive 1 (Since Trump’s inauguration NASA still doesn’t have a new administrator - MAGA) reshuffles NASA’s human exploration priorities, yet again, back to the Moon calling for the establishment an Earth-to-Moon infrastructure, including a permanent presence on the moon.</p>

<p>US space policy has vacillated and dithered like the Spiderman movies, every few years there appears to be a new one resulting in a cul-de-sac of underfunded and cancelled programs. There isn’t a long-term goal, a lodestar to help align short term missions to build momentum forward. Instead when Congress hits reset on the agency’s funding every year, it plays havoc with space projects that can take time to get off the ground resulting in lack of financial stability. Thus, budgetary and time pressures has given rise to a “go as you can afford to pay” framework granting little margin to deal with unanticipated hitches that arise during design and development. Overcommitted in terms of program obligations relative to resources available, the Challenger and Colombia disasters proved to be merely symptomatic of these underlying issues. Private entities like SpaceX have outmanoeuvred behemoth national space agencies such as NASA just as the Europeans outplayed China in a geopolitical game they didn’t even know they were players in. Despite these intrinsic problems, NASA admirably hasn’t abdicated its mantle at the boundaries of science and still manages to be as relevant as ever in fulfilling its promise of furthering human access to space. NASA will continue to be the hero human space endeavour needs, but not the one it deserves. A giant without whose shoulder to stand on, the commercial space industry would flounder.</p>

<p>Much of SpaceX’s base technology is in fact rooted in lessons from NASA’s own research and development over the decades; a testament to how government and industry can leverage expertise and resources effectually. NASA’s role in nurturing the nascent private spaceflight industry through public-private partnerships in the form of Commercial Resupply Service contracts, whereby cargo and supplies are delivered to the International Space Station (which saved SpaceX), and the multiphase Commercial Crew Development program can’t be understated. Through its commercial cargo and crew programs, NASA has enabled home-grown private companies like SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Boeing, and Sierra Nevada to develop a modern fleet of spacecraft to provide safe, reliable, cost-effective access to Low Earth Orbit whilst reaping cost savings for the taxpayer. The supply services offered by SpaceX and Orbital ATK have cost NASA <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170008895.pdf">two to three times</a> less than if NASA had continued to fly the space shuttle.</p>

<h3 id="the-heavenly-homestead-act">The Heavenly Homestead Act</h3>

<p>As the commercial arena of space swells in the coming years, formulation of sound policies to foster the innovations that will further lower space access costs will be integral in determining the revolutionary potential of private space industry. Not just NASA, governing bodies utilizing their purchasing power to provide base load demand for incipient space services and invest in resilient civil space infrastructure. Long term prospects won’t be solely determined by government based support and demand. It will have to be augmented by the commercial sector as well. Thus, policy makers need to set appropriate standards for accepting risk, encourage dynamic competition in the market, and introduce a transparent, well-structured, and minimally burdensome regulatory framework. This could be further strengthened or reinforced if carried out in the international setting as more nations such as Japan, China and India seek to amplify their presence in Outer Space. More ideally it would be awesome, if the spirit of international collaboration and cooperation manifest in efforts such as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html">International Space Station</a> are extended into commercial space efforts as well.</p>

<h3 id="united-corporations-space-command">United Corporations Space Command</h3>

<p>Cross-pollination of ideas has been the linchpin of human advancement.  If genetic diversity and ecological variety are healthy for a biosphere, problem diversity and solution variety is tantamount for the innovations that helps us address all sorts of modern hurdles and bottlenecks. Humanity lies at the base of a steep learning curve. As intellectual connections within and across disciplines proliferate, and as we leverage our ever-growing collective capacities to crunch through mountains of data, paradigm shifts in the models and theories that govern our contemporary thought are bound to happen. This process of challenging deep assumptions embedded in our thinking and society is integral to humanity’s growth as a species.</p>

<p>Every paradigm has limits and else we confront them progress stalls and civilization would be suspended in stasis or worse yet stagnate and degrade. State funding lines up better with the costs and time horizons of fundamental science often without applications in view. The pay offs and return on investments too far off and uncertain and thus undesirable for those with profit motive. From Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, to recent examples of blue-skies research such as the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN in Geneva or the Human Genome Project unfettered, fundamental, curiosity-driven research is essential for flourishing human potential. Revolutions in science that shatter paradigms are spun out of such science and state money is traditionally the spinner. However, in America, for example, for the first time in the post–World War II era, the federal government funds less than 50% of the basic research carried. State patronage has flattened due to austerity strangling research budgets and has become conservative due to public pressure to show value for money. Interestingly, here too corporations are superseding nations by increasingly investing in moon-shot thinking.</p>

<p>Audacity is what is missing in our public arenas. It’s what stokes public confidence in the leadership and what produces discoveries that uproot the norms. Current anti globalist, xenophobic and insular protectionism sentiments are inevitable response of a populace subject to short term small minded initiatives in face of growing uncertainty, complexity and entanglement of society. An audacious international space program empowered and complemented by the private sector would instil and inspire a shared human vision like no other. From the Knights of Templar to Coco-Cola, private corporations have always had little to no regard about national boundaries (oft for self-serving reasons). In a somewhat similar vein, I believe private space enterprise as they collaborate across borders would similarly disregard nationalistic divisions and serve as a bridge to a universal percipience of hope and confidence, one which nations have foundered to realise, by pushing the boundaries of human experience itself.</p>

<p>If asked, “What happened in 1492?”, most would answer ‘ah I know Columbus discovered America’. Not many of us would be spewing details about how England and France signed a peace treaty, neither would we be debating about the implications of the death of Lorenzo de Medici: the most powerful patron of the Renaissance, nor would we be conversing about the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel. A robust space initiative of our time will be in my contention, a standing monument of the 21st Century for posterity. One that cannot be encapsulated in a mere cost/benefit analysis. A millennium from now, we are not going to be remembered for which faction came out on top in Syria, or Crimea, or wherever. Our epoch will be instead remembered hopefully for when humanity first ventured off the shores of the uncharted interstellar ocean and saw it from afar as a wanderer, lost amongst the stars.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-i">APPENDIX I</h2>
<p>This is but a cursory look into NASA’s effort in the field of Space Medicine that I wrote but don’t feel like deleting</p>

<p>Space flight has always been an intrinsically risky endeavour, however as we attempt to sustain long-term presence in orbit and further out into the Solar System, the health risks posed to humans are manifold. Microgravity as experienced on the ISS, has undesirable effects on various bodily systems especially the circulatory, musculoskeletal and immune systems. Fluid distribution is the challenging one. On earth, gravity body fluids tend to pool in the legs. To counter this effect of gravity, veins in human legs have evolved valves that open and close to assist blood circulation back up to the heart. In orbit, however, blood pressure equalizes and fluids tend to reverse what they do on Earth and pool toward the head. This shift of blood and other fluids toward the head precipitates many problems. The brain’s hypothalamus interprets its increased blood supply as an increase in total fluid volume rather than simply a redistribution. In response to this misperception, the brain signals the kidneys and other organs to decrease the volume of blood and other fluids by pulling water out through increased urination. The decrease in fluid volumes is not in itself a problem, but the process in turn triggers losses of minerals such as calcium, which leads to loss of critical bone minerals. Other complications caused by this issue include increased excretion of calcium from your bone coupled with dehydration resulting in formation of kidney stones and greater possibility of osteoporosis-related problems when returning to Earth.</p>

<p>Biomedical research conducted in space is essential for us to gain a better understanding of the health risks of long-duration spaceflight and to develop ways to minimise and mitigate these risks. This is where NASA’s [Human Research Program’s] (https://www.nasa.gov/hrp) findings have been paramount in bridging our knowledge gaps on the effects and impacts of space flight on the human body. One of its major successes achieved over years of trial and error study has been a solution to the physical deconditioning explained above whereby bones lose minerals, with density dropping at over 1% per month. These days astronauts go through a 2-hour exercise regime everyday involving high intensity exercises on treadmills, cycles and resistive exercise devices. Applying resistance and pressure on the bones and muscles assists the rebuild of bone lost. As scientists learn more about the various risks, some risks grow in significance. For example, cancer was believed to be the most significant risk associated with radiation exposure (Galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles), but research has shown that central nervous system effects such as impaired motor skills and seizures may also be a major concern. Building risk models for radiation’s long-term effects have also been challenging due to the small sample size of astronauts.</p>

<p>NASA still faces significant challenges and uncertainties in ensuring the safety of crew members on a possible human mission to Mars or deep space out of the protective magnetosphere of our planet for a prolonged time. Deep space presents a more unforgiving environment in terms of radiation and isolation from Earth (it takes on average 14mins for light to reach Mars – that’s 28mins of round-trip time latency for information) compared to Low Earth Orbit. Psychosocial stressors have also been identified as one of the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance even in the ISS, where every minute has a timeline and NASA leaves nothing to chance walking astronauts through the day without need for improvisation. Thus, the scope of the challenges and demands that face astronauts in deep space increase dramatically as astronauts will have to transition from a command-centric model to a more crew centred one which may result in greater tensions and psychological issues over prolonged periods of time in an isolated alien environment. Now these perils to both physical and mental faculties sound frightening but NASA is investing substantial amount of resources to mitigate these risks. Significant brainpower is being dedicated to discovering the best methodology and technologies to support safe, productive human space travel.  Artificial Gravity produced by centrifugal forces has been proposed as a possible solution for the weightlessness problem, lightweight radiation shielding materials are being considered and even novel propulsion technologies to reduce transit times. Effective mitigation of the risks to human health posed by long duration missions is a significant undertaking that can only be achieved with effective management and collaboration across various disciplines such as life sciences, engineering, nutrition, material and social science to engineer effective and human solutions. By continuing to leverage assets through national and international collaborations just as NASA has, I am confident human spaceflight will only get safer with time.</p>

In the meantime, we shall prepare, for the brave skytravellers, maps of the celestial bodies – I shall do it for the moon, you Galileo, for Jupiter ––– Johannes Kepler, Letter to Galileo Galilei, April 1610 Cold War’s Celestial Chariots ‘beep-beep’, a sound of wonder and disquietude reverberated, literally and figuratively; across the skies as even amateur radio operators tuned in to listen in on the transmissions @ 20.005MHz. The Pravda christened it as an ‘artificial moon’ one that had scaled up the terrestrial gravity well, which had bound humanity to this Pale Blue Dot. Alan Shepard had just graduated from the Naval War College. John F. Kennedy was still a junior senator from Massachusetts. Yuri A. Gagarin was an unremarkable Russian military pilot. While the ‘father of rocket technology’: Wernher von Braun was working on the Jupiter ballistic missiles. Little did these men know this unpretentious small sphere would manage to capture human imagination and paranoia: metastasizing in the global consciousness and cast a very large shadow indeed. A new era of exploration was about to dawn. It was the 4th of October 1957 and the Soviets had just launched the Sputnik. humanity, got odyssey inside my DNA The history of humanity has always hung onto a timeline of exploration. For millennia, since modern humans emerged in the horn of Africa we were wanderers. We meandered past vast landmasses, across forbidden seas and narrow straits, down rolling valleys in search of plentiful game and congenial climates. The impetus to explore has had unmistakable survival value. As the last ice age ended and the ice thawed, we settled down marking the beginnings of the Neolithic Age. We domesticated plants animals, and in turn they domesticated us. Thenceforth empires have risen, developed, devolved and fallen, blood has been spilt in the name of gods, pharaoh and queen. As change came to define human history, the itch for exploration was one that was sempiternal regardless of ones ethnicity, ideology or geography. Phoenicians surveyed the Mediterranean Sea pushing through the Pillars of Hercules (Strait of Gibraltar) into the Atlantic. Polynesians settled on every habitable island in the Pacific till Hawaii traversing 16 million square miles of treacherous ocean guided by just the stars and the currents whilst Vikings touched the coast of modern day Canada half a millennium before Columbus. On the behest of Admiral Zheng He, Ming Era ocean going junks crisscrossed the Indian Ocean sailing as far away as Hormuz on the Persian Gulf and Aden on the Red Sea. The Age of Discovery saw Europeans (re)discover the New World subsequently circumnavigating the globe. In recent times, few of us have claimed the adobe of the gods of old soaring 400km up. We owe these feats to a restless few: irrepressible renegades drawn by a yearning that they could barely understand nor articulate themselves. JFK and his Technocrats It is a humbling irony that spaceflight—conceived in the tile cauldron of nationalistic rivalries and vitriol—was the harbinger of a shared human vision. Tremendous acceleration of the space programme in the 1960s, got humans to the moon before the end of that decade. John F. Kennedy as a president was lukewarm on committing to an aggressive space program before pivotal events in 1961. He was not a starry-eyed idealist enraptured with the romantic image of the final frontier in space nor consumed by dreams of a spacefaring civilization. On the other hand, he was a maestro of cold war rhetoric with a keen sense of Realpolitik in foreign affairs. Yuri Gagarin’s orbital mission aboard Vostok 1 coupled with the failed Bay of Pigs debacle, displayed the Kennedy administration’s technical and strategic incompetence as the power struggle over the ‘fluid battleground’ of the Third World tipped in the Soviet’s favour. United States’ security hinges as much on winning hearts and minds as it does on military might. Thus Kennedy in a bid to recapture leadership in space so as to project America’s soft power believed “that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth”. The challenge required the mobilization of resources on a national scale to develop and apply the pioneering technologies of their times. This in turn called for skilful management of administrative capacity, a responsibility that fell upon NASA and the Federal Government. A frontier narrative was sold to the media and the public by the administration subsuming arguments about the technology and economics of the program, and established a presumption in favour of massive commitments of the nation’s resources to manned space flight. The Cold War realities of the time, therefore, served as the primary vessel for an expansion of NASA’s activities launching the premier civil space effort to a broad consensus of support. ‘We came in peace for all mankind’ the lunar plaque placed by Apollo 11 crewmembers read while megatons of explosives were being dropped in Vietnam. Children of Apollo The Apollo space program, however mired it was in Cold War jingoism, accentuated the undeniable recognition of the interdependence and frailty of the Earth. The first-hand transcendental experience of viewing the blue ball of life floating in the great enveloping darkness, shielded by a paper-thin atmosphere has been proven to stem a cognitive shift in thinking, time and time again by astronauts and cosmonauts alike. National boundaries vanish. The conflicts that divide us become trifling and the full folly of human conceits come to bare. Just as humanity conceived instruments of death capable of exceptional self-harm, this revelation underscored our responsibility to protect this fragile biosphere and all its members emboldening the environmental and humanitarian movements of recent decades. In the realm of science and technology, rock and soil samples brought back are still vital to lunar and planetary science investigations. Lunar surface layers serve as archives frozen in time storing records in the form of solar wind particles, the cosmogenic products of cosmic ray impacts, and meteoritic debris. The wealth of information derived from the chemical and mineralogical nature of the lunar surface has reshaped and enriched our knowledge of lunar origins, geological evolution and thus informing us of the more general processes of planetary formation. These soil layers have been studied extensively elucidating the processes critical to understanding the development of our early inner Solar System ranging from core formation to magmatic activity to solar evolution. Spillover technological developments, the result of huge government autonomous investments pushed the boundaries of civil, electrical, aeronautical engineering and the sciences. This financial kickstart for fledgling technologies resulted in a technological trickledown which has rippled down the decades that followed. Precision matching, robotic welding and assembly, photovoltaic cells and the list goes on. For instance, Apollo Guidance Computer designed by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory was central to the evolution of the integrated circuit, forerunner to the microchip, and is regarded as the first embedded system. The guaranteed market and premium prices paid by the NASA and military in the early days of the Integrated Circuits were decisive factors in determining the success of the industry, and led toward mass-produced, low-cost chips for the subsequent personal computing and the unprecedented digital revolution. Under the aegis of the Apollo program, we augured in the golden era of space exploration stretching till the 1980s before the traumatic Challenger incident. We dispatched engineered robotic spacecraft to the far recesses of the Solar System, conducting reconnaissance of dozens of alien worlds. From the flybys of the Mariners and Pioneers to the soft landing of the Soviet Venera 8 these probes functioned as windows into these distant worlds illuminating our understanding of our Solar System. Utilizing the gravity assist manoeuvre, the Voyager Probes took advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that occurs once every 175 years to send probes on a “Grand Tour”. These probes reshaped our view of the gas giants and have just crossed the heliopause, destined perhaps eternally to be runaways in the stellar void of the Milky Way. While manned spaceflight stalled, planetary science thrived. We currently have dozens of these robotic emissaries sending us back wondrous data daily. Withdrawal Syndrome Since the heydays of space exploration being buffeted by the winds of political change has become standard operating procedure for NASA. The Apollo Program inspired the generations that followed, a story of ordinary people realising extraordinary dreams. Nonetheless the widespread consensus which spawned it would prove to be an anomaly: the result of an elusive alignment of national decision-making process with the aspiration of space exploration. Amusingly for a program designed to demonstrate the superiority of the free-market system, it succeeded by mobilising vast public resources within the mechanizations of a centralised bureaucracy under government directive. Proposals had been drawn up for a more resilient human presence in cislunar space, involving more substantial infrastructure such as reusable shuttles, orbital transfer vehicles, propellant depots and permanent space stations orbiting both Earth and Moon. However, these were discarded except for a scaled back Space Shuttle program under the Nixon Doctrine. Public-Private partnership for commercial activity in space, which could have served as a bypass to the government centric control and execution of the national space program, didn’t arise either. Thus, the very bureaucracy that landed man on the moon in less than a decade, would end up stifling further manned spaceflight as the political rationale that once fuelled it evaporated. “The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind.” ––– ADAM SMITH IN HIS WEALTH OF NATIONS, MARCH 1776 Merchants betwixt Worlds Enterprise has always thrived more strongly in the presence of strong private and social incentives to reward risk-taking. Ming Dynasty China was a centralised bureaucratic monolith. There was little marketplace for ideas beyond those the state approved and promising ventures – such as Zheng He’s naval expeditions in the early 15th century to promote trade links across East Africa and the Indian Ocean – could be and was scuppered by imperial decree. Conservative risk averse factions in court viewed these extravagant tours as unwise wasteful expenditure expressing widespread disapproval. The succeeding Emperor Hongxi adopted a more sustainable inward-looking policy and eventually in 1525 the government ordered the destruction of all oceangoing ships. Thus, the potential of the Treasure Fleet and Ming Dynasty’s maritime pre-eminence was never fully realized. In sharp contrast, Europe, flanked by and shoved out by the dominant Ottoman Empire to the East, comprised of many small, fragmented, weak and increasingly warring states. Thus, political geography served as an impetus to rulers who were desperate for sources of revenue especially through lucrative trade routes to feed burgeoning mercantilism at home and their ratcheting military appetite. Headstrong or obstinate (depending on how you see it) men, sponsored by the ruling class, compelled by faith, greed and grandeur would attempt to navigate the seas for alternate routes to the Indies. The greatest blundering genius of them would probably be Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus who rarely knew where he was, let alone where he was going but open the gates to the riches of the New World (or as Columbus would have you believe even on his deathbed the Orient) he did. The magic of it all is if Queen Isabella had rejected Columbus’s proposition or if Columbus himself crashed into some boulder, the ports of Europe had lionhearted men and the wealthy aristocrats required to bankroll them aplenty. Consequently, the voyage to the New World would have occurred regardless. In the dizzying years that followed, almost anything and everything seemed possible to the conquistadors and adventurers who crossed the Atlantic and rounded Africa sustained by innovations in financial instrumentation and continent-wide market activity. The rest as they say is history, Europe plundered and got a whole new continent while Native Americans subjugated, got smallpox. These events transpired due to compelling incentives, however unscrupulous or delusional, for individuals who would end up tilting the axis of the planet in the West’s favour. About four centuries later, the Spirit of St. Louis, in lieu of Santa Maria, full flying speed – controls taut, alive and straining – would attempt to conquer the Atlantic, this time however heading back to the Old World in search of the City of Love. The Lindbergh Boom It was the May of 1927, a lone monoplane emerged from across the Parisian horizon. In the spartan cockpit was an obscure air-mail pilot from over 3000 miles away. As Charles Lindberg descended on the Le Bourget Field to the adulation of crowds numbering in the 100,000s, the aviation industry took flight. The historic non-stop flight across the Atlantic displayed the potential of long distance flight. In no time, Wall Streeters were banging on doors, policy makers churning out civil air safety guidelines and capital flew in as interest in commercial aviation skyrocketed. Within less than a century, a world without aviation is unimaginable. The dreams of flight and that of private space flight are twins, conceived by similar visionaries and evolving with many parallels. Just as the Orteig Prize of $25000 motivated Charles and his backers to attempt to cross the Atlantic, the 10 million-dollar Ansari X Prize incentivised Burt Rutan’s (legendary aerospace engineer who also designed the first plane to fly around the world without stopping or refuelling) Scaled Composite backed by, co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen. They launched the rocket-powered SpaceShipOne from a mothership 14km up. It arced through space and crossed the Karman Line, an arbitrary line which lies at an altitude of 100km, and repeated the feat within a week kickstarting the dreams of the commercial spaceflight industry. This time it was deep pocketed billionaires spawned in the nucleus of the 21st century start-up culture who went knocking on doors as they set their gaze up to the stars seduced by the commercial potential of human access to space. Private spaceflight reawakened the promise of manned spaceflight. Rockets require vast time, resources and expertise to be assembled, launched into space, and in the end either unceremoniously burnt up in the atmosphere or crash into the ocean as scrap metal. Imagine an aviation industry as inefficient, the only aircraft flying around would be Air Force One. The need for an inexpensive reusable vehicle has been the obvious step for the 40 years since the Apollo Era. The Space Shuttle program was conceived on that very premise, aiming to launch payloads for under $100 a pound with one launch per week on average. However, NASA never delivered and instead trapped man within Low Earth Orbit for 30 years. After each mission, the orbiter and the solid rocket boosters required extensive inspection and repairs, consequently getting to orbit remained a risky and expensive proposition as NASA struggled to translate the reusable orbiter and solid rocket boosters to tangible capex savings. The program reached an anticlimactic halt in 2011 after 133 successful flights with a payload cost of an exorbitant $10,000 per pound. Compared to the $81 million per astronaut NASA pays the Russians to send them to Low Earth Orbit on the Soyuz, the entire SpaceShipOne endeavour only cost $27 million. After selling the technology to Virgin Galactic founded by Richard Branson, Paul Allen turned a net profit and suddenly the free market economics of spaceflight appeared workable resulting in a dynamic explosion in spaceflight that government alone can never hope to mimic. By then, real-life Tony Stark, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, had already established under the radar aerospace companies, Space Exploration Technologies Corp and Blue Origin respectively. Both were enamoured by chimerical dreams, one of multi-planetary expansion and the other of lifting heavy industry into outer space with millions living and working off-world. From having vodka shots with Russians for the purchase of ICBMs on the open market to recovering Apollo F-1 engines three miles beneath the Atlantic, these visionaries seem to have gotten immunization shots for risk that the rest of us forgot to get when we were born. Irrespective of their differences over means of fulfilling their ambitions, they agree that the final frontier proffers the solution to the quagmire we are tangled in on Earth. Vectors of Infection Planet-bound civilizations not only impose limitations on the material enlargement of civilization, it also places us as a species in a precarious spot. We reside in an inter-galactic neighbourhood that is dynamic armed with a couple of definite ways to sterilize the thin film of life inhabiting the surface and countless more theoretical ones. When it comes to destruction of worlds we also happen to be our worst enemy. Nations possess thousands of nuclear warheads capable of occasioning an existential catastrophe, and we are at the liberty of a fairly fragile global ecosystem as we belch greenhouse gases to fuel our ever-increasing needs and wants. It could be argued there is a moral imperative to act on behalf of life itself of which we are at least the bearers, if not the sole possessors, to act as its dispersal vector. Life since it’s inception has reached out to cover every niche it can. Neil Armstrong’s first words on the Moon were a massive understatement, that step was as significant as the one our amphibian cousins took 400 million years ago onto land. Being a spacefaring civilization is the first step toward assuring the durability of civilization and ensuring our visibility to natural selection on a cosmological scale. This vision of making life multi-planetary was one that would transmogrify a spreadsheet into SpaceX that would in the coming years re-enact a sophisticated parody of David and the Goliath. “After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest to the USA to bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline.” — RUSSIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DMITRY ROGOZIN, AFTER U.S SANCTIONS PRECIPITATED BY THE UKRAINIAN CRISIS Draining the Swamp In an industry brimming with middleman price hikes and literally decades-old legacy technology, SpaceX’s firmly controlled in-house supply chain and trailblazing technology has it competing as the world’s cheapest option for space delivery even besting China’s Long March’s price point. Whereas established commercial launch consortiums like International Launch Services and Europe’s Arianespace once scoffed at the California upstart, the success of SpaceX has them rapidly scrambling to cut their own launch costs and pursue reusable rockets of their own as their decade long military-industrial complex business model heads for the dust heap of history. For years, the US government had relied on two major aerospace companies—Boeing and Lockheed Martin, along with their joint venture, United Launch Alliance (ULA)—for domestic launches. They made their money through pulling strings at Capitol Hill and cozy military and government relationships for vastly inflated sole-source contracts ( SpaceX will sue the Airforce over this to be certified for military and intelligence payloads) costing an average of $380 million per launch. Traditional aerospace companies tend to outsource their production to sub-contractors and these contractors in turn sub-contract to layers further down the supply chain, resulting in massive overheads. Their operations were bloated and technology were stale hardly distinguishable from their Soviet and now Russian counterparts. In fact, ULA’s Atlas III and later the Atlas V, were powered by Russian RD-180 first-stage rocket engines. That’s right US defence satellites, which probably snoop and spy on Russia, can’t be launched without the Russians themselves. SpaceX brought the tsunami - organizational ethos of Silicon Valley: lean manufacturing, vertical integration, flat management to this stagnant swamp of an aerospace industry. Engendering the tectonic shifts in propulsion technology, spacecraft design and reusability requisite for this tsunami to take form, however, has been anything but easy. It’s tough For 6 long years, a good 4.5 years more than expected, SpaceX wrestled with the chains of gravity. Three times, from the spring of 2006 to the summer of 2008, it had seen the lean, single-engine Falcon 1 rocket lift off from an atoll in South Pacific only to fail to reach orbit. By then Elon Musk had sunk hundreds of millions of dollars in developmental cost, racking up personal debt and both his companies Tesla and SpaceX had little revenue to show for it. On September 28, 2008, a cash-strapped SpaceX executed its first successful launch becoming the world’s first privately built rocket to achieve Low Earth Orbit. In SpaceX’s darkest hour as it struggled to meet payrolls, NASA ushered in the dawn offering SpaceX a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract to make 12 deliveries for them to the International Space Station. This infusion of cash reinforced the capital-intensive transition from a single Merlin-engined Falcon 1 rocket to the much more exigent Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon Space Capsule. What followed were rapid succession tests and iterations to achieve cadence with the Falcon 9. Milestones were cleared one after another. First privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft. Check. First to dock and berth a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Check. Elon’s Reusable Ark Concurrently the reusable launch system technology development program would evolve to become the focal point of SpaceX’s energy and resources. The low-altitude, low-velocity hover/landing test vehicle, Grasshopper and the subsequent vertical-launch &amp; vertical-landing Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicles served as a development testbed for SpaceX’s first propulsive landing of an orbital rocket’s first stage on land in December of 2015. The audacity of the concept and breakneck pace of development has been breath-taking to witness. On April 8, 2016, Falcon 9 Flight 23, delivered the SpaceX CRS-8 cargo on its way to the International Space Station while the first stage conducted a boostback and re-entry manoeuvre over the Atlantic Ocean. Nine minutes after lift-off, the booster landed vertically on an autonomous drone ship aptly named ‘Of Course I Still Love You’, 300 km from the Florida coastline, achieving another long-sought-after milestone for the SpaceX reusability development program. SpaceX has indicated that they are now able to consistently “reenter from space at hypersonic velocity, restart main engines twice, deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity”. To date, SpaceX has successfully brought Falcon 9 first stages back to Earth 21 times during orbital missions, and four of those landed boosters have flown again. Though engineers initially shelved the idea, they now intend to develop the technology for a scorching re-entry to extend reusable flight hardware to second stage. This is a more daunting technical challenge considering the vehicle is travelling at high delta velocity usually so that the payload can reach geostationary orbit. Invisible Pressurised Glove 2018 is starting out with a bang (not a literal one I hope) as the current phase in SpaceX’s journey culminates with the maiden launch of Falcon Heavy happening this week. Between the mission in the Dragon 2 to the ISS flown under NASA’s Commercial Crew Development Program marking the first manned launch from US soil since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 (it’s competing against old guard, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner) and the slated plans of sending two space tourists on a free return trajectory around the Moon, this year is shaping up to be hopefully the most riveting year in the SpaceX saga. To realise his visions of a sustainable human civilization on Mars, Musk is now diverting resources into a next generation rapidly reusable spacecraft named as ‘BFR’ ,which is capable of producing an astounding 52 meganewtons worth of thrust at sea level (That’s right enough to lift off with an adult blue whale as payload and land back with it). But it gets better, this colossus of a rocket will have the lowest marginal cost per launch accounting for reusability of any spacecraft ever. This could in theory lower the cost of lifting material into orbit by an entire magnitude. The cost of the propellant (fuel/oxidizer combo) on the BFR is absurdly low as the Raptor engines, currently under development, only rely on liquid oxygen and densified liquid methane. As the cost of placing and maintaining capability in space falls dramatically, it transforms sense of possibility providing a platform to leapfrog the feasibility of every endeavour in space. The presence of this robust commercial market, in turn, through economies of scale, would result in a further fall in the cost of access to space. Suddenly the heavens themselves, appear pedestrian. “Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever” — KONSTANTIN TSIOLKOVSKY, FROM A LETTER WRITTEN IN 1911 Lighthouse for Skywalkers Here is the wonderful part. Just as in the ports of Europe 500 years ago, where private and social incentives galvanized men with heartwood of oak to sail the Atlantic, so too it inspires the innovators of today to spearhead through the atmosphere into orbit. SpaceX is not alone. Blue Origin has successfully completed the fifth launch and landing of the very same suborbital New Shepard rocket and crew capsule. Bigelow Aerospace has already launched inflatable space station modules into Low Earth Orbit. Orbital ATK has made deep investments in developing its on-orbit robotic satellite servicing capabilities to tackle space logistics challenges. NASA in partnership with the private firm Made in Space has installed a 3D printer customised to operate in microgravity in the ISS, this opens the door to on-orbit manufacturing using the very materials that in the future might be sourced in space. Companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries are beginning work on asteroid mining capabilities to prospect and extract materials, minerals and even synthesise propellant through processes such as electrolysis in space. These headways if proven sustainable would eventually mature to fully fledged industries. These are few of the multitude of pathfinders in the bottom-up emergent order which is redefining the space industry (if I talk about all these endeavours with more depth, I would be suffering from Alzheimer’s by the time I would be done but thankfully the cure for it would have been discovered as well). It is no wonder why analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect the private space industry, which is valued at $350 billion right now, to octuple to nearly a $2.7 trillion valuation in the next 30 years as one realises we are sitting on the precipice of an entrepreneurial metamorphosis. The Scarred Knight To a generation that felt the risk-averse sclerotic government tethered space program had failed them, their dreams of spaceflight might be actualised. You need look no farther than compare the development of the Falcon series of vehicles with the NASA Ares 1, Ares 5, and now the Space Launch System. NASA is currently betting on large appropriations in the coming years that will enable it to undertake a massive, Apollo-like undertaking to set sail for Mars. However, it has not been able to command that kind of budget since the 1960s. The fundamental barrier is institutional. The space agency has been squeezed and suffocated by parochial Congressional meddling for years. The political establishment of today neither has the will nor the resolve to pursue a concerted long-range initiative towards manned spaceflight beyond the Low Earth Orbit. From the days of the Raegan Administration Star Wars program, where space architects dreamt of kinetic and particle beam weapons and all kinds of bedlam, flip-flop has been the name of the game for the mercurial American Space Policy. Take this century as an exemplification, first there was the George Bush era Constellation program that was supposed to develop a sustained human presence on the Moon but instead America categorically decided it’s better to have a sustained human presence in Iraq. Upon taking office, President Obama declared the program to be “over budget, behind schedule, and lacking in innovation” cancelling it and redirecting NASA’s focus to sending people to an asteroid, and then once again set its sights on a human Journey to Mars. Then Trump’s Space Directive 1 (Since Trump’s inauguration NASA still doesn’t have a new administrator - MAGA) reshuffles NASA’s human exploration priorities, yet again, back to the Moon calling for the establishment an Earth-to-Moon infrastructure, including a permanent presence on the moon. US space policy has vacillated and dithered like the Spiderman movies, every few years there appears to be a new one resulting in a cul-de-sac of underfunded and cancelled programs. There isn’t a long-term goal, a lodestar to help align short term missions to build momentum forward. Instead when Congress hits reset on the agency’s funding every year, it plays havoc with space projects that can take time to get off the ground resulting in lack of financial stability. Thus, budgetary and time pressures has given rise to a “go as you can afford to pay” framework granting little margin to deal with unanticipated hitches that arise during design and development. Overcommitted in terms of program obligations relative to resources available, the Challenger and Colombia disasters proved to be merely symptomatic of these underlying issues. Private entities like SpaceX have outmanoeuvred behemoth national space agencies such as NASA just as the Europeans outplayed China in a geopolitical game they didn’t even know they were players in. Despite these intrinsic problems, NASA admirably hasn’t abdicated its mantle at the boundaries of science and still manages to be as relevant as ever in fulfilling its promise of furthering human access to space. NASA will continue to be the hero human space endeavour needs, but not the one it deserves. A giant without whose shoulder to stand on, the commercial space industry would flounder. Much of SpaceX’s base technology is in fact rooted in lessons from NASA’s own research and development over the decades; a testament to how government and industry can leverage expertise and resources effectually. NASA’s role in nurturing the nascent private spaceflight industry through public-private partnerships in the form of Commercial Resupply Service contracts, whereby cargo and supplies are delivered to the International Space Station (which saved SpaceX), and the multiphase Commercial Crew Development program can’t be understated. Through its commercial cargo and crew programs, NASA has enabled home-grown private companies like SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Boeing, and Sierra Nevada to develop a modern fleet of spacecraft to provide safe, reliable, cost-effective access to Low Earth Orbit whilst reaping cost savings for the taxpayer. The supply services offered by SpaceX and Orbital ATK have cost NASA two to three times less than if NASA had continued to fly the space shuttle. The Heavenly Homestead Act As the commercial arena of space swells in the coming years, formulation of sound policies to foster the innovations that will further lower space access costs will be integral in determining the revolutionary potential of private space industry. Not just NASA, governing bodies utilizing their purchasing power to provide base load demand for incipient space services and invest in resilient civil space infrastructure. Long term prospects won’t be solely determined by government based support and demand. It will have to be augmented by the commercial sector as well. Thus, policy makers need to set appropriate standards for accepting risk, encourage dynamic competition in the market, and introduce a transparent, well-structured, and minimally burdensome regulatory framework. This could be further strengthened or reinforced if carried out in the international setting as more nations such as Japan, China and India seek to amplify their presence in Outer Space. More ideally it would be awesome, if the spirit of international collaboration and cooperation manifest in efforts such as International Space Station are extended into commercial space efforts as well. United Corporations Space Command Cross-pollination of ideas has been the linchpin of human advancement. If genetic diversity and ecological variety are healthy for a biosphere, problem diversity and solution variety is tantamount for the innovations that helps us address all sorts of modern hurdles and bottlenecks. Humanity lies at the base of a steep learning curve. As intellectual connections within and across disciplines proliferate, and as we leverage our ever-growing collective capacities to crunch through mountains of data, paradigm shifts in the models and theories that govern our contemporary thought are bound to happen. This process of challenging deep assumptions embedded in our thinking and society is integral to humanity’s growth as a species. Every paradigm has limits and else we confront them progress stalls and civilization would be suspended in stasis or worse yet stagnate and degrade. State funding lines up better with the costs and time horizons of fundamental science often without applications in view. The pay offs and return on investments too far off and uncertain and thus undesirable for those with profit motive. From Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, to recent examples of blue-skies research such as the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN in Geneva or the Human Genome Project unfettered, fundamental, curiosity-driven research is essential for flourishing human potential. Revolutions in science that shatter paradigms are spun out of such science and state money is traditionally the spinner. However, in America, for example, for the first time in the post–World War II era, the federal government funds less than 50% of the basic research carried. State patronage has flattened due to austerity strangling research budgets and has become conservative due to public pressure to show value for money. Interestingly, here too corporations are superseding nations by increasingly investing in moon-shot thinking. Audacity is what is missing in our public arenas. It’s what stokes public confidence in the leadership and what produces discoveries that uproot the norms. Current anti globalist, xenophobic and insular protectionism sentiments are inevitable response of a populace subject to short term small minded initiatives in face of growing uncertainty, complexity and entanglement of society. An audacious international space program empowered and complemented by the private sector would instil and inspire a shared human vision like no other. From the Knights of Templar to Coco-Cola, private corporations have always had little to no regard about national boundaries (oft for self-serving reasons). In a somewhat similar vein, I believe private space enterprise as they collaborate across borders would similarly disregard nationalistic divisions and serve as a bridge to a universal percipience of hope and confidence, one which nations have foundered to realise, by pushing the boundaries of human experience itself. Cosmic Cathedrals If asked, “What happened in 1492?”, most would answer ‘ah I know Columbus discovered America’. Not many of us would be spewing details about how England and France signed a peace treaty, neither would we be debating about the implications of the death of Lorenzo de Medici: the most powerful patron of the Renaissance, nor would we be conversing about the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel. A robust space initiative of our time will be in my contention, a standing monument of the 21st Century for posterity. One that cannot be encapsulated in a mere cost/benefit analysis. A millennium from now, we are not going to be remembered for which faction came out on top in Syria, or Crimea, or wherever. Our epoch will be instead remembered hopefully for when humanity first ventured off the shores of the uncharted interstellar ocean and saw it from afar as a wanderer, lost amongst the stars. APPENDIX I This is but a cursory look into NASA’s effort in the field of Space Medicine that I wrote but don’t feel like deleting Space flight has always been an intrinsically risky endeavour, however as we attempt to sustain long-term presence in orbit and further out into the Solar System, the health risks posed to humans are manifold. Microgravity as experienced on the ISS, has undesirable effects on various bodily systems especially the circulatory, musculoskeletal and immune systems. Fluid distribution is the challenging one. On earth, gravity body fluids tend to pool in the legs. To counter this effect of gravity, veins in human legs have evolved valves that open and close to assist blood circulation back up to the heart. In orbit, however, blood pressure equalizes and fluids tend to reverse what they do on Earth and pool toward the head. This shift of blood and other fluids toward the head precipitates many problems. The brain’s hypothalamus interprets its increased blood supply as an increase in total fluid volume rather than simply a redistribution. In response to this misperception, the brain signals the kidneys and other organs to decrease the volume of blood and other fluids by pulling water out through increased urination. The decrease in fluid volumes is not in itself a problem, but the process in turn triggers losses of minerals such as calcium, which leads to loss of critical bone minerals. Other complications caused by this issue include increased excretion of calcium from your bone coupled with dehydration resulting in formation of kidney stones and greater possibility of osteoporosis-related problems when returning to Earth. Biomedical research conducted in space is essential for us to gain a better understanding of the health risks of long-duration spaceflight and to develop ways to minimise and mitigate these risks. This is where NASA’s [Human Research Program’s] (https://www.nasa.gov/hrp) findings have been paramount in bridging our knowledge gaps on the effects and impacts of space flight on the human body. One of its major successes achieved over years of trial and error study has been a solution to the physical deconditioning explained above whereby bones lose minerals, with density dropping at over 1% per month. These days astronauts go through a 2-hour exercise regime everyday involving high intensity exercises on treadmills, cycles and resistive exercise devices. Applying resistance and pressure on the bones and muscles assists the rebuild of bone lost. As scientists learn more about the various risks, some risks grow in significance. For example, cancer was believed to be the most significant risk associated with radiation exposure (Galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles), but research has shown that central nervous system effects such as impaired motor skills and seizures may also be a major concern. Building risk models for radiation’s long-term effects have also been challenging due to the small sample size of astronauts. NASA still faces significant challenges and uncertainties in ensuring the safety of crew members on a possible human mission to Mars or deep space out of the protective magnetosphere of our planet for a prolonged time. Deep space presents a more unforgiving environment in terms of radiation and isolation from Earth (it takes on average 14mins for light to reach Mars – that’s 28mins of round-trip time latency for information) compared to Low Earth Orbit. Psychosocial stressors have also been identified as one of the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance even in the ISS, where every minute has a timeline and NASA leaves nothing to chance walking astronauts through the day without need for improvisation. Thus, the scope of the challenges and demands that face astronauts in deep space increase dramatically as astronauts will have to transition from a command-centric model to a more crew centred one which may result in greater tensions and psychological issues over prolonged periods of time in an isolated alien environment. Now these perils to both physical and mental faculties sound frightening but NASA is investing substantial amount of resources to mitigate these risks. Significant brainpower is being dedicated to discovering the best methodology and technologies to support safe, productive human space travel. Artificial Gravity produced by centrifugal forces has been proposed as a possible solution for the weightlessness problem, lightweight radiation shielding materials are being considered and even novel propulsion technologies to reduce transit times. Effective mitigation of the risks to human health posed by long duration missions is a significant undertaking that can only be achieved with effective management and collaboration across various disciplines such as life sciences, engineering, nutrition, material and social science to engineer effective and human solutions. By continuing to leverage assets through national and international collaborations just as NASA has, I am confident human spaceflight will only get safer with time. Thoughts? This is my first time writing in forever so let me know how to improve. Is it too long like Bladerunner 2049 or too short like Tyrion Lannister? Maybe you have a different perspective on the topic? I would love to here your thoughts down below.]]></summary></entry></feed>
