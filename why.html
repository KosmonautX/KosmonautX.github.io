 “You are not only responsible for what you say, but also for what you do not say” supposed Martin Luther: a monk and scholar of relative anonymity oft confused with Martin Luther King. I for one haven’t been very responsible for what I have said. One summer night I had an revelation, that I should compensate by trying to be more responsible for what I do not say. This epiphany has taken on a life of its own and led to my own army bookouts descending into madness. I don’t know how long this website idea conceived by this epiphany is going to last, but here it is unaborted as I identify myself as pro-life.
