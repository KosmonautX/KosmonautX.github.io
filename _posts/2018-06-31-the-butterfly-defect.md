## The Last Question

The entire becoming of the cosmos is defined by the gradual unraveling of disorder. A halting and subsequent leaping of entropic growth which is neither expeditious nor uniform. Vast regions of matter and energy may remain for prolonged periods trapped in configurations of local stability and order till there too channels for such growth open. An unopened dam in the mountains. A primordial nebula of contracting hydrogen. Yugoslavia. All states are merely transitory bound to be distant memories drowned out by the inexorable dance of time.

Entropy, as stated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is a measurement of the instinctive state of highly disordered equilibrium toward which energy tends. In a closed system the availability of useful energy can only decline. A lump of coal is a high quality highly ordered form of energy which upon combustion will produce heat a dispersed disordered form of energy. To reverse this sequence is brain-bendingly impossible as the products for such a reaction cannot be reconstituted back into a lump of coal. Ice cubes melting. Hopelessly attempting to write non-messy software. And the Iran Nuclear Deal. In every sequence of events that looks weird if we ran it in reverse we notice this universal tendency playing out. Thus, the creationist would lead you believe that such elegant creatures like pterodactyls, iguanas or humans couldn’t arise without the Grace of the Lord. You are after all a being of highly intricate structure and complexity. If I threw all your rich organic matter into a giant fruit blender, there are a far greater number of possible arrangements of the end states of the system in which it resembles a gooey sludge rather than that of assuming a humanoid form. The caveat that enables our local system to derive such order from the theatrical thermodynamic chaos of the universe is an entirely one sided cosmic trade deal.



{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/entropy/energydensity.png" alt="Energy Density" caption="In the past, humanity has typically adopted energy sources that have greater power density: packing more punch per gram and requiring less land to produce. Renewables (green), however, are lower in density than fossil fuels (brown). That means a move to renewables could vastly increase the world’s energy production footprint, barring a vast expansion of nuclear power." %}


I secretly believe that true progress is
a fantasy, and that I need to prepare for the end times, and for the chickens
coming home to roost, and fast zombies, and slow zombies, and the polite
zombies who say “sir” and “ma’am” but then try to eat your brain to acquire
your skills. When the revolution comes, I need to be prepared; thus, in the
quiet moments, when I’m not producing incredible scientific breakthroughs,
I think about what I’ll do when the weather forecast inevitably becomes
RIVERS OF BLOOD ALL DAY EVERY DAY. The main thing that I ponder is
who will be in my gang, because the likelihood of post-apocalyptic survival
is directly related to the size and quality of your rag-tag group of associates.
There are some obvious people who I’ll need to recruit: a locksmith (to open
doors); a demolitions expert (for when the locksmith has run out of ideas);
and a person who can procure, train, and then throw snakes at my enemies
(because, in a world without hope, snake throwing is a reasonable way to
resolve disputes). All of these people will play a role in my ultimate success
as a dystopian warlord philosopher. However, the most important person in
my gang will be a systems programmer. A person who can debug a device
driver or a distributed system is a person who can be trusted in a Hobbesian
nightmare of breathtaking scope; a systems programmer has seen the terrors
of the world and understood the intrinsic horror of existence. The systems
programmer has written drivers for buggy devices whose firmware was
implemented by a drunken child or a sober goldfish. The systems programmer
has traced a network problem across eight machines, three time zones,
and a brief diversion into Amish country, where the problem was transmitted
in the front left hoof of a mule named Deliverance. The systems programmer
has read the kernel source, to better understand the deep ways of the
universe, and the systems programmer has seen the comment in the scheduler
that says “DOES THIS WORK LOL,” and the systems programmer has
wept instead of LOLed, and the systems programmer has submitted a kernel
patch to restore balance to The Force and fix the priority inversion that was
causing MySQL to hang. A systems programmer will know what to do when
society breaks down, because the systems programmer already lives in a
world without law.
