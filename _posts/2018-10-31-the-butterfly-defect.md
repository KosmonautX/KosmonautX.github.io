> The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground – what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?

The entire becoming of the cosmos can be defined as the gradual unraveling of disorder. A halting and subsequent leaping of entropic growth which is neither expeditious nor uniform. Vast regions of matter and energy may remain for prolonged periods trapped in configurations of local stability and order till there too channels for such growth open. An unopened dam in the mountains. A primordial nebula of contracting hydrogen. Yugoslavia. All states merely transitory, bound to be distant memories drowned out by the inexorable dance of entropy.

Entropy, as stated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is a measurement of the instinctive state of highly disordered equilibrium toward which energy tends. In a closed system the availability of useful energy can only decline. A lump of coal is a high quality highly ordered form of energy which upon combustion will produce heat a dispersed disordered form of energy. To reverse this sequence is brain-bendingly impossible as the products for such a reaction cannot be reconstituted back into a lump of coal. Ice cubes melting. Hopelessly attempting to write non-messy software. And the Iran Nuclear Deal. In every sequence of events that looks weird if we ran it in reverse we notice this universal tendency playing out. Elegant creatures like pterodactyls, iguanas or orcas haven't arisen out . You are after all a being of highly intricate structure and complexity. If I threw all your rich organic matter into a giant fruit blender, there are a far greater number of possible arrangements of the end states of the system in which it resembles a gooey sludge rather than that of one assuming a humanoid form. The caveat that enables our local system to derive such order from the theatrical thermodynamic chaos of the universe is an entirely one sided cosmic trade deal.

 tamed the selective pressures that molded us and paved the way towards greater social complexity. From the inertial frame of the biological red queen we are guzzling down nitro. Humanity has come not only to dominate but to define the natural landscape. However one realises that though supposedly freed from our biological red queen paradox through exploiting the twin towers of metabolic

## Interlude
A planet bejeweled in the dead of the night
A direction beyond our own making
It's system wide in causality and impact and  thus not convertible into compelling cultural forms that transmit danger and urgency. Few challenges facing civilization during the twenty-first-century will be as daunting, and as critical, as the preservation of the biosphere’s integrity.

To orchestrate such sophisticated expressions of energetic utility would be impossible without the continuous supply of various inputs.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/entropy/energydensity.PNG" alt="Energy Density" caption="In the past, humanity has typically adopted energy sources that have greater power density: packing more punch per gram and requiring less land to produce. Renewables (green), however, are lower in density than fossil fuels (brown). That means a move to renewables could vastly increase the world’s energy production footprint, barring a vast expansion of nuclear power." %}

Choreography Life optimises sustained fitness Co-evolving systems act in concert as the results of the dynamic of the system they do so as a result of individuals within the community myopically optimising their own ends and not as collective agreement toward a common goal. A critical process in the organisation of biodiversity specifically because it is simultaneously flexible yet conservative in how it shares interspecific intersections in a dynamic world.
No longer confined to random mutations or genetic reorganization cultural cooperationw opened up a new trajectory for growth powered by subsystems of language, toolmaking and imitation. The integration and interplay of the metabolic and informational flows intertwining human players across spatialities and temporalities have

For over two billion oxygenic  photosynthesis were the engines of the living world. Mine the rich ores concentrated over billion years by the Earth's dynamic geology.
All multicellular life forms require cell to cell adhesion and sophisticated intercellular communication. Systems of intercommunication are essentiality for growth and structural integrity. The greater information carrying capacity of eukaryotic cells was a definite prerequisite for this of course. Constellations of networked structures interacted and evolved over spatial and temporal scales

 Our energetic backbone defines the scope and limits of our visions for the future, like a waiter that demarcates our appetites by handing us a menu. The canals we have built to channelize this energetic flux are crumbling under their own narrative weight as fundamental realities
 Yesterdays articles of faith are crumbling leaving behind a disorientating husk. What once was pronounced eternal and sacred appear to be merely illusionary veiled behind the ever mutating mist of change. The hijacking of the global operating system by the concept of open ended exponential growth has borne myopic growth predicated institutions. However this operating system along with its institutions are not scalable into the 21st Century and haven't been for a while. What awaits isn't a world defined by some celestial tranquility. The trappings of modernity is instead defined by uncertainty, volatility and turbulence, a deal offered without options for renegotiation. All fixed relations and ancient prejudices are swept away like sand, and new structures become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air. It isn’t easy to live in such a chaotic world, and it is even harder to govern it.

## The Thanos Trap
Balance in all things ~
Collectively humanity now mobilizes unprecedented social and functional metabolism. We churn the cauldrons of creation materialising truths. Our capacities stretched as cycles of innovation shrink. This dynamic is inreconcilable with fundamental biological timescales. At the atomised individual scale one can expect to see several major disruptions within our lifetime , one our socioeconomic fabric as of now is simply not woven to sustain. A truth betrayed by our fragile institutions who appear to have developed a serious allergy with ground realities.

The interface between the planet's ecological capital and our socioeconomic sphere is systemically degenerative, more strained than that pathological relationship in Gone Girl. Obfuscating reality
