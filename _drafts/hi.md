## Representation of Thought

Thinking tools adapt unthinkable thoughts to our human minds. Two of the greatest such tools are writing and mathematical notation.{% margin %}By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by "complex situations" we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids. {% endmargin %}

## Background
What is already known or unknown? Set the scene.

Modes of thinking are often intertwined with the context within which they operate. The human mind in the presence of an abacus for instance exploits it much like a scaffold around which to structure cognitive operations. These artefacts are not purely physical   they can also Computational objects have in recent years displaced

## Timetable
Indicate the timeframe for each broad stage considering literature surveys, data collection, production, modelling, review, analysis, testing, reporting, and report submission date.


## Project Scopes and Key Objectives


Ideation:
Rather than exteriorizing knowledge we will be building new primitives for constructing knowledge  Rather than outsourcing cognition, it’s about changing the operations and representations we use to think; it’s about changing the substrate of thought itself. And so while cognitive outsourcing is important, this cognitive transformation view offers a much more profound model of intelligence augmentation. It’s a view in which computers are a means to change and expand human thought itself. 
Technical Stack:
Decentralized system of Pis -- relaying of information and processing 
Reactive state based database that federates the Yggdrasil protocol so multiple tables can communicate and  share information and libraries
Consider how a program runs on your laptop: the program mostly uses your mouse and keyboard for input and your display for output, and it executes on the CPU on your laptop's logic board.

But the Yggdrasil   model is much more general and powerful than this particular configuration. It's not really about cameras, projectors, dots, or pages at all. It's a protocol for all kinds of live, physical, reprogrammable computing.

The Pi connects well with the physical world, because it has all these ports and pins it can use to talk to sensors and actuators. You can plug motors in and make the Pi drive around  or attach a touch sensor. Building a virtual ecosystem in a physical world.

Communication of Thought

The particular methodological needs and nuances of our research goals and context bear examination. We clarify these first and then pursue their implications in terms of the methodological challenge we necessarily set for ourselves. This leads to a discussion of the methods themselves.

First, our research represents departure from teacher inquiry in that, although we are methods teachers, we were not concerned with researching our own practice but a set of diverse practices related to the different methods being taught in short or long courses, inside and outside of universities. As we have outlined, reflective practice contributions to the field perform an important function but they do not come from a place of pedagogic research and can be unconnected to theory or each other. This meant a need for a more comprehensive look at research methods pedagogy as a field rather than a set of individualized practices.

Second, the methods teachers and learners with whom we needed to engage were not well-placed to conduct their own pedagogic research independently, but could work with us co-productively. Methods teachers in the social sciences may be from any of the social science disciplines; their disciplinary and methodological expertise usually provide them with the necessary content knowledge for methods teaching. Their pedagogic knowledge is (as we found in the study) likely to come from experience, peer dialogue and primarily trial-and-error in responding to the constraints they recognize. While they develop pedagogic content knowledge, they do so in a very tacit way, making it hard for them to recognize and share. This may make for invisible pedagogy (Bernstein 1975), limiting the potential for teachers and learners to optimize ongoing learning and engagement. Collaboration with us as pedagogic researchers was, therefore, a productive way to building pedagogic culture. This mode of collaboration was informed by the teacher-led and action-oriented observation approaches of Japanese lesson study (Cerbin and Kopp 2006) applied in school-based research, while still enabling widespread knowledge transfer beyond the grass-roots, local understandings usually associated with lesson study methods (Lewis, Enciso, and Moje 2007).

Our positioning in the research was complex. As teachers and learners of research methods ourselves, although we would be outside the situations we would be researching, we could not be outsiders entirely. Nor could we be entirely insiders. Carroll (2009) uses the term ‘alongsider’ for researchers working with and alongside practitioners, placing a shared lens on the practice. This, and her feminist concept of ‘feeling alongside’ (254) was useful when thinking about our stance. Understanding that pedagogy is hard to know (Nind, Curtin, and Hall 2016), and that ‘teachers themselves have difficulty articulating what they know and how they know it’ (Shulman 1987, 6), our collection of methods needed some way of working alongside teachers and learners to tease out the pedagogic content knowledge at work. Moreover, the paucity of pedagogic culture in the field meant we needed to combine exploring research methods pedagogy with building pedagogic culture, rather than pedagogic culture building following on later. All of these purposes for the research culminated in the need for our research methods to have a transformative function for everyone involved in it – the methods needed to be methods that teach. Our own positionality, not just as teachers, learners and researchers, but as individuals with a history of working with disabled people, reinforced our cognizance of the political imperative for research to be transformative. Our research position and needs led to the challenge we articulate here: to find, adapt or develop research methods suited to collaborating on pedagogic knowledge production, reflecting an alongsider vantage point, and generating genuine dialogue and transformation. The challenge warrants further articulation as there are elements of it that will resonate for other pedagogic researchers. Moreover, while we faced the one challenge of bringing all these elements into play, no one method could meet the whole challenge.

The challenge of research methods that would allow us to work with teachers and learners in ways that could educate and transform us all has echoes of the wider move towards democratizing research or making it more inclusive (Seale, Nind, and Parsons 2014). This was about designing research that would avoid placing those teachers and learners as the objects of research done by others on them and respecting their agency as knowers and producers of knowledge, engaging in developing ‘shared knowledges and collective understandings’ (Erel, Reynolds, and Kaptani 2017, 303). However, participatory action research was not our launching point, as this would require methods teachers to identify a problem for themselves and sustain interest in working through cycles of action and reflection in addressing it. Individual methods teachers and small teams have been engaged in problem-solving, but the active commitment to understanding and developing pedagogy needed for an action research approach network is rare. We wanted to stimulate pedagogic interest by starting with a research project that would enhance understanding of how research methods teachers understand and enact their craft. This meant that, despite the obvious and educative transformative potential of action research – the ‘pedagogical practice of action research’ as Santoro Franco (2005, 1) proposes – we needed an alternative research design that would still incorporate a developmental element.

Potential teacher and learner participants could hardly be seen as marginalized or subjugated people kicking back against research that has harmed them, yet we still did not want a power dynamic that put us in charge of their experiences. Even academia, which some see as a rarified, elite and privileged space, is a place where community dialogue – through and about pedagogy – can be seen to be marginalized or occluded by the effects of neo-liberalism on the university. The marketization of higher education has pushed the discourse away from pedagogy and towards a discourse of metrics and consumerism. Despite the substantial educational and cultural capital that academics have accrued (Gill 2009) they are still compelled to act in highly individualized ways. With discipline as the locus around which academic identities gravitate (Clarke, Hyde, and Drennan 2013), methods teachers’ identities may be liminal – with teachers identifying more strongly with disciplinary research roles, methods and culture, rather than having a fully-fledged (or pedagogically informed) teacher/educator identity.
