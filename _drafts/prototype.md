> “Create vessels and sails adjusted to the heavenly ether, and there will be plenty of people unafraid of the empty wastes. In the meantime, we shall prepare, for the brave skytravellers, maps of the celestial bodies – I shall do it for the moon, you Galileo, for Jupiter” ––– JOHANNES KEPLER, LETTER TO GALILEO GALILEI, APRIL 1610

# Sirens in the Cosmic Fugue

   [‘beep-beep’](http://www.dd1us.de/sounds/DL3PD%20Alois%20-%2001%20-%20Sputnik%201%20first%20satellite%20reduced.mp3), a sound of wonder and disquietude reverberated, literally and figuratively; across the ionosphere as even amateur radio operators tuned in to the transmissions on 20.005MHz. The Pravda christened it as an ‘artificial moon’ as it climbed out the terrestrial gravity well, which had bound humanity to this Pale Blue Dot. 

Alan Shepard has just graduated from the Naval War College. John F. Kennedy was still a junior senator from Massachusetts with no noteworthy ambitions for spaceflight. Yuri A. Gagarin was an unremarkable Russian military pilot. While the ‘father of space travel’: Wernher von Braun was working on the Jupiter ballistic missiles. Little did these men know this unpretentious sphere would manage to capture human imagination and paranoia: metastasizing in the global consciousness ushering in an new era for exploration. It was the 4th of October 1957 and the Soviets have just launched the Sputnik. 


The history of humanity has always hung on a timeline of exploration. For millennia, since we emerged in the horn of Africa we were wanderers. Homo Sapiens meandered past vast landmasses, across forbidden seas and narrow straits, down rolling valleys in search of plentiful game and congenial climates. The impetus to explore has had unmistakable survival value. As the last ice age ended and the ice thawed, we settled down marking the beginning of the Neolithic Age. We domesticated plants and animals and in turn they domesticated us. 

Since empires have risen, grown and fallen, blood has been spilt in the name of gods, pharoh and queen and hundreds of generations have passed. Polynesians settled on every habitable island in the Pacific till Hawaii traversing 16 million square miles of treacherous ocean guided by just the stars and the currents. Admiral Zheng He and his Ming Era ocean going junks crisscrossed the Indian Ocean.  The Age of Discovery saw Europeans (re)discover the New World subsequently circumnavigating the globe. In recent times we have claimed the adobe of the gods of old, soaring 400km up. We owe these achievements to a few restless renegades drawn by a yearning that they can barely understand nor articulate themselves.

It is a humbling irony that spaceflight—conceived in the tile cauldron of nationalistic rivalries and vitriol—was the harbinger of a shared human vision. Tremendous acceleration of the space programme in the 1960s, got humans to the moon before the end of that decade. The Apollo program, however mired it was in ideological confrontation and instruments of death, highlighted the inescapable recognition of the interdependence and fragility of the Earth. But once that goal was achieved, that political rationale evaporated as quickly as it appeared.


Since the heydays of space exploration being buffeted by the winds of political change has become standard operating procedure for NASA.  Truly visionary goals will necessarily span multiple administrations.

## Vectors of Infection
Shaping a multiplanetary species. resides in a solar system that is dynamic and has a dozen or so ways to sterilize the thin film of life inhabiting the surface. When it comes to destruction of worlds we also happen to be our worst enemy. that will remain of us is a couple deep space probes and a few centuries of radio waves that will slowly emenate and fade into the CMB. Nations possess thousands of nuclear warheads capable of occasioning an existential catastrophe, and we are at the liberty of a fairly fragile global ecosystem with limited resources. Beyond that, our being confined to this single planet means that a single asteroid collision or some other unforeseen cataclysmic event could wipe out our entire species and potentially all intelligent life on Earth. There are numerous other theorised existential risks


Cross-pollination  If genetic diversity and ecological variety are healthy for a biosphere, similarly problem diversity and solution variety are healthy for the innovations that helps us address all sorts of modern hurdles and bottlenecks.

## Merchants of Worlds

 NASA is currently betting on large appropriations in the coming years that will enable it to undertake a massive, Apollo-like undertaking to set sail for Mars. However, it has not been able to command that kind of budget since the 1960s, when the space agency’s goals were aligned with the country’s national security aims to undermine the Soviet Union. However, this doesn't mean NASA has abdicated the lead in spaceflight. has nurtured this process, too. It has opened up its segment of the International Space Station for research and as a platform to launch cubesats. through its commercial cargo and crew programs, NASA has enabled private companies like SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Boeing, and Sierra Nevada to develop a new, modern fleet of spacecraft.

  In recent years, SpaceX has upended the rocket industry. Whereas established rocket companies like United Launch Alliance and Arianespace once scoffed at the California upstart, the success of SpaceX has them rapidly scrambling to cut their own launch costs and pursue reusable rockets. Analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) expect the private space industry, which is valued at $350 billion right now, to octuple to nearly $2.7 trillion in the next 30 years.


 "What happened in 1492?", most would answer ‘ah I know Columbus set sail for America’. Not many of us would be spewing details about how England and France signed a peace treaty, neither would we be debating about the implications of the death of Lorenzo de Medici : the most powerful patron of the Renaissance, nor would we be conversing about the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel. A robust space program of our time will be in my contention, a standing monument of the 21st Century which cannot be encapsulated in a mere cost/benefit analysis. A millennium from now, we are not going to be remembered for which faction came out on top in Crimea, or Syria, or wherever.  Our epoch will be remembered for when humanity first ventured off the shores of the cosmic ocean and saw it from afar as a wanderer, lost amongst the stars.

At this critical juncture for humanity 
Private spaceflight reawakened the promise of manned spaceflight sparked by the 
Outmanoeuvring behemothean national space agencies such as NASA which are clamped down by bureaucracy injecting much needed dynamism into the industry.
Deep pocketed billionaires

Long term prospects It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector.
In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations

Kennedy as president had little direct interest in the U.S. space program. He was not a visionary enraptured with the romantic image of the last American frontier in space and consumed by the adventure of exploring the unknown. He was, on the other hand, a Cold Warrior with a keen sense of Realpolitik in foreign affairs, and worked hard to maintain balance of power and spheres of influence in American/Soviet relations. The Soviet Union’s non-military
