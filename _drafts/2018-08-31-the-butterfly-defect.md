## ESTABLISH

In a subcontinent mired in contradictions : a colorful cacophony of splendor and squalor resounding merely a paper's thickness away and more often than not one and the same. In a subcontinent where a mere snapshot does no justice to the unabated circus of life and death that simply overwhelms an unready spectator. Where the profane struggles to assemble anything that resembles order. However here purposeful rectilinear urban blocks emerges against the encircling chaos of wayward dirt paths and mismanaged infrastructure that had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man’s purpose. Euclidean geometry willed against the natural non-linear dynamics. Perhaps this will is conjured by the bureaucratic nucleus cloistered at the heart of the borough. Yet a distant pulse drowns this intuition. Averting one's gaze few miles south uncovers the underlying, both in the literal and figurative sense, beat of the heart that this urban edifice drums along to. A topography of open wounds Peppering the barren lunarlike topography standing flat as mesas that betrays the scope of mankind’s uneasy and conflicted relationship with nature. The story of coal. Upon closer inspection one would witness 2600 ton of German engineering ingurgitating through the lignite seams imported from the Soviet Union under Indo-Soviet assistance programme. Nehruvian Vision This remote hamlet in today occupies a pre-dominant place in the industrial and power map of India. As a microcosm of the wider metabolism of our contemporary society the fossil fuels have hijacked and staged an upheaval. Second it would appear only in importance to those whom plough the land.


## SOMETHING AINT RIGHT

> But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? How much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered, how many lies have had to be sanctified, how many consciences disturbed, how much "God" sacrificed every time? If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed: that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled! --- FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY


## ACROSS THE THRESHOLD INTO UNFAMILIARITY

> "Come...dry your eyes. For you are life, rarer than a quark and unpredictable beyond the dreams of Heisenberg; the clay in which the forces that shape all things leave their fingerprints most clearly. Dry your eyes... and let's go home.”
--- ALAN MOORE, WATCHMEN

Call to adventure
An axial shift in the geometry of civilization and what it means to be human.
A call for nothing less than redefining human progress else we lose that which is human

The entire becoming of the cosmos can be defined as the gradual unraveling of disorder. A halting and subsequent leaping of entropic growth which is neither expeditious nor uniform. Vast regions of matter and energy may remain for prolonged periods trapped in configurations of local stability and order till there too channels for such growth open. An unopened dam in the mountains. A primordial nebula of contracting hydrogen. Yugoslavia. All states merely transitory, bound to be distant memories drowned out by the inexorable dance of entropy.

Entropy, as stated in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is a measurement of the instinctive state of highly disordered equilibrium toward which energy tends. In a closed system the availability of useful energy can only decline. A lump of coal is a high quality highly ordered form of energy which upon combustion will produce heat a dispersed disordered form of energy. To reverse this sequence is brain-bendingly impossible as the products for such a reaction cannot be reconstituted back into a lump of coal. Ice cubes melting. Hopelessly attempting to write non-messy software. And the Iran Nuclear Deal. In every sequence of events that looks weird if we ran it in reverse we notice this universal tendency playing out. Elegant creatures like pterodactyls, iguanas or orcas haven't arisen out . You are after all a being of highly intricate structure and complexity. If I threw all your rich organic matter into a giant fruit blender, there are a far greater number of possible arrangements of the end states of the system in which it resembles a gooey sludge rather than that of one assuming a humanoid form. The caveat that enables our local system to derive such order from the theatrical thermodynamic chaos of the universe is an entirely one sided cosmic trade deal.

Choreography Life optimises sustained fitness Co-evolving systems act in concert as the results of the dynamic of the system they do so as a result of individuals within the community myopically optimising their own ends and not as collective agreement toward a common goal. A critical process in the organisation of biodiversity specifically because it is simultaneously flexible yet conservative in how it shares interspecific intersections in a dynamic world.
No longer confined to random mutations or genetic reorganization cultural cooperation opened up a new trajectory for growth powered by subsystems of language, toolmaking and imitation. The integration and interplay of the metabolic and informational flows intertwining human players across spatialities and temporalities have

All multicellular life forms require cell to cell adhesion and sophisticated intercellular communication. Systems of intercommunication are essentiality for growth and structural integrity. The greater information carrying capacity of eukaryotic cells was a definite prerequisite for this of course. Constellations of networked structures interacted and evolved over spatial and temporal scales

## Interlude
A planet bejeweled in the dead of the night
To orchestrate such sophisticated expressions of energetic utility would be impossible without the continuous supply of various inputs. A direction beyond our own making. Not only is the hand that weaves much of this 4 Dimensional Web invisible it is blind as well.
It's system wide in causality and impact and  thus not convertible into compelling cultural forms that transmit danger and urgency. Few challenges facing civilization during the twenty-first-century will be as daunting, and as critical, as the preservation of the biosphere’s integrity.

Our energetic backbone defines the scope and limits of our visions for the future, like a waiter that demarcates our appetites by handing us a menu. The canals we have built to channel this energetic flux are crumbling under their own narrative weight. These growth predicated institutions much like a seasoned used car salesman obfuscate and obscure the fundamental reality underlying this unscalable growth regime model.
Yesterdays articles of faith are crumbling leaving behind a disorientating husk. What once was pronounced eternal and sacred appear to be merely illusionary veils swept away by the ever-mutating winds of change. The hijacking of the global operating system by the concept of open ended exponential growth has borne myopic growth predicated institutions. However this operating system along with its institutions are not scalable into the 21st Century and haven't been for a while. What awaits isn't a world defined by some celestial tranquility. The trappings of modernity is instead defined by uncertainty, volatility and turbulence, a deal offered without options for renegotiation. All fixed relations and ancient prejudices are swept away like sand, and new structures become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air. It isn’t easy to live in such a chaotic world, and it is even harder to govern it.

## The Thanos Trap
Balance in all things ~
Collectively humanity now mobilizes unprecedented social and functional metabolism. We churn the cauldrons of creation materialising truths. Our capacities stretched as cycles of innovation shrink. This dynamic is irreconcilable with fundamental biological timescales. At the atomised individual scale one can expect to see several major disruptions within our lifetime , one our socioeconomic fabric as of now is simply not woven to sustain. A truth betrayed by our fragile institutions who appear to have developed a serious allergy with ground realities.
